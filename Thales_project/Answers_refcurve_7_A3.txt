The graph highlights the disparity in ozone loss trends between the two polar regions. The Antarctic's ozone loss is characterized by its persistently high levels, reflecting the enduring presence of the ozone hole, which has been a significant environmental concern for decades. Meanwhile, the Arctic's ozone loss, while generally lower, shows sharp increases at irregular intervals, indicating episodic events that lead to temporary but substantial depletion. This comparison underscores the different environmental challenges faced by the two regions and the need for tailored approaches to monitor and mitigate ozone depletion in each area.
