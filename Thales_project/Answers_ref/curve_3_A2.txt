The graph depicts years along the horizontal axis and global temperature anomalies on the vertical axis, based on data from HadCRUT5, GISTEMP, NOAA, ECMWF, and Berkeley Earth.  While global temperature anomalies fluctuate across all measurement indices, a general upward trend is evident. Notably, this increase has been more significant since 1975.
