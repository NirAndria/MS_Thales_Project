The individual named Dahlia, listed with ID 18, did not receive an invitation. Dahlia is also part of the Flower group, and the invitation status is marked as "undeliverable." Similar to Hydrangea, the reasons for the undeliverable status could include an incorrect address or postal service issues. The implications for Dahlia are the same as for Hydrangea, including potential feelings of exclusion and missed opportunities. Event organizers should take steps to verify addresses and ensure timely delivery of invitations.
