The graph illustrates time in milliseconds on the horizontal axis and voltage in volts on the vertical axis.  The voltage stays constant at 0 volts up to 52 ms. It then rises steeply, reaching a peak of 1.75 volts at 62 ms. Afterward, the voltage drops to -0.9 volts at 70 ms before gradually returning to 0 volts, where it remains steady.
