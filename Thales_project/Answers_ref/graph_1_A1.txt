The graph presents the distribution of incomes for men and women in 2016 in the form of a histogram. The unit of measurement on the horizontal axis is the dollar, and the vertical axis corresponds to the number of individuals.

The two distributions are similar but show some notable differences. In fact, the income distribution for women appears to be more concentrated towards lower salaries, while the income distribution for men is somewhat better spread out. This is why we can observe a slight shift to the right in the distribution of men's salaries compared to women's salaries. For this reason, we cannot assert that the salary distribution was the same for men and women in 2016 based on this graph.
