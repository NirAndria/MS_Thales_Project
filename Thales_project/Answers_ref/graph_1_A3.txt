The graph displays a histogram of income distributions for men and women in 2016. The horizontal axis measures income in dollars, and the vertical axis represents the number of individuals.  While the distributions are broadly similar, key differences stand out. Women’s income distribution tends to cluster around lower salaries, while men’s distribution is more spread out, leading to a slight rightward shift in the men’s salary distribution. Thus, the data suggests that income distributions for men and women in 2016 were not the same.
