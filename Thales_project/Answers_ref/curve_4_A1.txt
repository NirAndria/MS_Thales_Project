The worst model is the one with a learning rate of \(10^{2}\), as the loss curves for both training and test sets diverge wildly without approaching zero. This model fails to achieve a loss below 8, even after 180 iterations, demonstrating poor convergence and overfitting. Moreover, the training and test loss curves are vastly different, indicating instability and poor generalization.
