Over the three decades depicted, there is a clear cyclical pattern in ozone loss, with significant reductions observed approximately every 5-7 years. The SAOZ data series consistently reports the highest ozone column loss percentages, particularly evident in the peaks around 2011 and 2020. Reprobus and Slimcat, while following the same trend, show slightly lower values, indicating that these methods might be more conservative in their estimates or are calibrated differently. This cyclical pattern could be linked to atmospheric phenomena or external factors influencing ozone depletion.
