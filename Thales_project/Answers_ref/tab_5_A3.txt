The screws with a diameter of M8 and a length of 65 mm are made of steel. Steel is a commonly used material in the manufacturing of screws due to its strength, durability, and resistance to wear and tear. The specific combination of M8 diameter and 65 mm length ensures that these screws can be used in a wide range of mechanical and structural applications where high levels of tension or pressure might be applied. The steel construction of these screws contributes to their ability to withstand these forces while maintaining their structural integrity. Steel screws, especially those with precise measurements such as M8 and 65 mm, are typically used in industries like construction, automotive, and manufacturing where reliable fastening solutions are critical. The material properties of steel, including its corrosion resistance (especially if coated), enhance the screw's longevity and overall performance in various environments.
