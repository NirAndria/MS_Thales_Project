The database schema shown in Hecataeus is useful for business intelligence applications.
 It enables the visualization of table relationships, such as CUSTOMER placing 
ORDERS linked to SUPPLIERs. Hecataeus can help in indexing foreign keys, reducing 
join costs, and suggesting denormalization where needed. To optimize large-scale 
queries, partitioning and materialized views can be used to enhance query efficiency,
 ensuring faster reporting and decision-making processes.
