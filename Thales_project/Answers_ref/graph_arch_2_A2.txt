Hecataeus is a schema visualization tool that helps in understanding database 
relationships and optimizing performance. The image shows a schema similar to TPC-H, 
where key tables like CUSTOMER, ORDERS, and SUPPLIER are connected. The tool assists 
in detecting inefficient joins, optimizing indexing, and ensuring proper normalization.
 By analyzing dependencies, database administrators can enhance query speed and reduce 
unnecessary data duplication. Indexing frequently used joins and partitioning large
 tables like ORDERS and LINEITEM can improve performance for analytical queries.
