The described process involves heating air from 5°C to 20°C while maintaining a constant relative humidity of 70%. Starting from these two points on the psychrometric chart, it is evident that the absolute humidity remains constant since relative humidity does not change, implying no variation in latent energy. The sensible energy variation, on the other hand, is directly related to the temperature increase. Hence, sensible energy increases with the rise in air temperature, while latent energy remains null as humidity has not changed. Total enthalpy, which is the sum of sensible and latent energy, corresponds only to the variation in sensible energy in this case. In summary, this process represents isohumid heating, where the added thermal energy only serves to increase the temperature without affecting the air's humidity.
