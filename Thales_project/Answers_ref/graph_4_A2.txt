In this process, the air is heated from 5°C to 20°C while maintaining a constant relative humidity of 70%. Given that the relative humidity remains unchanged, the absolute humidity also stays constant, resulting in no change in latent energy. Sensible energy, however, increases as the temperature rises. Consequently, the total energy change is only due to the increase in sensible energy, as there is no variation in latent energy. This process can thus be described as isohumid heating, where the heat added only raises the air temperature without altering its humidity.
