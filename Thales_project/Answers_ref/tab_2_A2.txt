The table displays the outcomes of two regression analyses. One regression uses ROTA as the dependent variable, while the other uses OPM. Both models share the same set of 10 explanatory variables.  In the model with OPM as the dependent variable, two variables are significant, but only the variable Dg is significant at the 5% confidence level.
