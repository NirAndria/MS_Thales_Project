The model with a learning rate of \(10^{2}\) is the least effective, as both the training and test loss curves diverge significantly, never approaching zero. Even by iteration 180, this model fails to achieve a loss below 8, demonstrating slow convergence and poor generalization. Furthermore, the wide gap between the training and test loss curves indicates instability and a significant difference between the two sets.
