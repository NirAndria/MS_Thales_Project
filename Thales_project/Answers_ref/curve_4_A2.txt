The worst model is the one with a learning rate of \(10^{2}\), as the loss curves for both training and test sets fail to converge, instead diverging rapidly. This model never achieves a loss below 8, even after 180 iterations, demonstrating inefficient convergence and poor generalization. Moreover, the training and test loss curves remain far apart, indicating a large difference between the two sets and poor model stability.
