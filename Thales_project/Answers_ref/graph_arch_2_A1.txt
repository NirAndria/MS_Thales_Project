Schema Analysis & Query Optimization with Hecataeus:
Hecataeus allows database administrators to explore dependencies between entities, 
such as how CUSTOMER connects to ORDERS, which in turn links to SUPPLIER and PART.
By visualizing relationships, users can identify potential query bottlenecks, such 
as costly joins between large tables.
The tool can also help in assessing indexing strategies, suggesting appropriate 
indexes for frequently joined tables to speed up query performance.
Additionally, it can highlight redundant relationships or unnecessary denormalization,
 which may negatively impact storage and query efficiency.
