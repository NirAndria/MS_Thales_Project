The graph displays time in milliseconds along the horizontal axis and voltage in volts along the vertical axis.  Initially, the voltage stays at 0 volts until 52 ms. It then increases rapidly, peaking at 1.75 volts at 62 ms. Following this, the voltage decreases to -0.9 volts at 70 ms before gradually rising back to 0 volts, where it stabilizes.
