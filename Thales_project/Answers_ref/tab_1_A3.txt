The table presents the quantile values for the Chi-squared distribution in relation to degrees of freedom and the significance level. Additionally, the image shows how the p-value corresponds to the quantile value when the degrees of freedom exceed 100.  For 10 degrees of freedom and a test value of 20, the test is significant at a 5% significance level, since the quantile value is 18.31. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis.
