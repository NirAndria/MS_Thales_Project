The graph illustrates the fluctuation in ozone column loss percentage from 1990 to 2020, with notable peaks around the years 1998, 2006, 2011, and 2020. The data series labeled Reprobus, Slimcat, and SAOZ show similar trends but vary in magnitude, with SAOZ generally showing higher peaks in ozone loss compared to the other two series. This suggests that while all three measurement methods capture the same general pattern of ozone depletion, there are differences in the extent of loss they record, possibly due to variations in measurement techniques or data processing methods.
