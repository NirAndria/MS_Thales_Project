The histogram illustrates the income distribution for men and women in 2016. The horizontal axis represents income in dollars, while the vertical axis shows the number of individuals.  Although the two distributions share similarities, there are notable differences. Women’s income distribution is more concentrated around lower salaries, whereas men’s income distribution is more dispersed. Consequently, the men’s distribution shifts slightly to the right compared to women’s. Therefore, this graph suggests that the income distributions for men and women in 2016 were not identical.
