Blue arrows for positive discussions.
Gray arrows for neutral discussions.
Red arrows for negative discussions.
When assessing connectivity, Group 7 (green) stands out as the most connected. It occupies a central position in the network and maintains numerous links to other groups. The dominance of blue arrows surrounding this group suggests a high level of positive interactions, reinforcing its significance in the network.

Furthermore, Group 7â€™s extensive connections, both incoming and outgoing, indicate that it serves as a crucial bridge between different groups, fostering communication and engagement across the entire network.
