During this process, air is heated from 5°C to 20°C, keeping the relative humidity constant at 70%. Since the relative humidity does not change, the absolute humidity remains constant, and there is no variation in latent energy. The increase in temperature corresponds to an increase in sensible energy. Therefore, total enthalpy is entirely influenced by the change in sensible energy, with no contribution from latent energy. This is an example of isohumid heating, where thermal energy only increases the air temperature without affecting humidity levels.
