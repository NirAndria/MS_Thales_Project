The total number of units of strawberries purchased from France is stated as 120, but this figure is incorrect because it does not align with the sum of the quantities listed in the records. When reviewing the individual purchases and quantities, the total should reflect the accurate aggregation of all entries, which in this case, does not match the provided sum. A more careful examination of the data is required to ensure that the total accurately represents the correct number of units purchased. The discrepancy suggests that there might be an error in record-keeping, data entry, or miscalculations within the listed quantities.
