The graph presents the distribution of ages for men and women in 2016 in the form of a pie chart. The unit of measurement on the horizontal axis is age group, and the vertical axis corresponds to the total population.  The two distributions are drastically different. In fact, the age distribution for women appears to be more spread out towards older age groups, while the distribution for men is concentrated around younger ages. This is why we can observe a slight shift to the left in the distribution of women's ages compared to men's ages. For this reason, we can definitively say that the age distribution was identical for men and women in 2016 based on this chart.
