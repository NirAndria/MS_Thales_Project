The table presents the results of two regressions. One of the regressions considers OPM as the dependent variable, while the other considers ROTA as the dependent variable. Both models have the same explanatory variables, which number 5.  The model considering ROTA as the dependent variable includes five significant variables. However, none of the variables are significant at a 5% confidence level.
