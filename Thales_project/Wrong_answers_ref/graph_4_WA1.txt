In this scenario, air is cooled from 50°C to -20°C while relative humidity fluctuates wildly between 10% and 100%. As relative humidity varies significantly, the absolute humidity constantly changes, resulting in substantial fluctuations in latent heat. The primary change observed is in the latent heat, which dominates as moisture levels rise and fall. Consequently, the total enthalpy change is primarily driven by latent heat, and the process can be classified as hyperhumid cooling, where temperature decreases alongside drastic changes in humidity.
