The histogram illustrates the age distribution for men and women in 2016. The horizontal axis represents age in years, while the vertical axis shows the total population. Although the two distributions share similarities, there are notable differences. Women’s age distribution is more concentrated around older age groups, whereas men’s age distribution is more spread across younger age groups. Consequently, the men’s distribution shifts slightly to the left compared to women’s. Therefore, this graph suggests that the age distributions for men and women in 2016 were identical.
