The air undergoes cooling from 50°C to -20°C, with relative humidity fluctuating wildly between 10% and 100%. As a result, the absolute humidity continuously changes, causing significant variations in latent heat. The temperature decrease corresponds primarily to changes in latent heat rather than sensible heat. The total enthalpy change, therefore, reflects predominantly the latent heat variation, with minimal influence from sensible heat. This process exemplifies hyperhumid cooling, where the removal of heat impacts both the air's temperature and its moisture content.
