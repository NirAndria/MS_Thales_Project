The graph displays time in seconds along the horizontal axis and current in amperes along the vertical axis. Initially, the current fluctuates between 0 and 5 amperes until 52 seconds. It then decreases slowly, reaching 0.5 amperes at 62 seconds. Following this, the current rises sharply to 2 amperes at 70 seconds before gradually decreasing back to 5 amperes, where it remains unstable.
