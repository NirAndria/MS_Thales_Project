The graph depicts months along the horizontal axis and local temperature fluctuations on the vertical axis, based on data from NOAA, METAR, and NASA. While local temperature fluctuations are relatively stable across all data sources, a general downward trend is evident. Notably, this decrease has been more pronounced since 1980.
