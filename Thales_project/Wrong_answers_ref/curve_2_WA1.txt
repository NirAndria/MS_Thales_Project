The graph shows temperature in Celsius on the horizontal axis and current in amperes on the vertical axis.  The voltage fluctuates randomly from the start, peaking at 10 volts at 30 ms. It then sharply drops to 5 volts at 50 ms, before suddenly increasing to 8 volts at 100 ms. Finally, the voltage continues to rise, never reaching 0 volts.
