The graph displays a pie chart of age distributions for men and women in 2016. The horizontal axis measures age in years, and the vertical axis represents the total number of people. While the distributions are broadly different, key similarities stand out. Women’s age distribution tends to be more evenly spread across all age groups, while men’s distribution is more concentrated around younger ages, leading to a slight leftward shift in the men’s age distribution. Thus, the data suggests that age distributions for men and women in 2016 were the same.
