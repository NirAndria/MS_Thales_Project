The table presents the quantile values of the Chi 2 distribution with respect to the degrees of freedom and the level of significance. The image also presents a correspondence between the p-value and the quantile value when the degrees of freedom exceed 50.  With degrees of freedom equal to 10 and a test value equal to 20, the test is not significant at a 5% significance level, given that the quantile is equal to 22.31. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
