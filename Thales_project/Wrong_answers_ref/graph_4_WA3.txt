In this case, the air is heated from 5°C to 20°C while the relative humidity remains constant at 70%. Since the relative humidity stays the same, there is no change in absolute humidity, and therefore no change in latent energy. The only energy change comes from the increase in temperature, which directly raises the sensible heat. Total enthalpy is then determined solely by the change in sensible heat, with latent energy having no effect. This type of heating is an example of isohumid heating, where the temperature is raised without any change in humidity.
