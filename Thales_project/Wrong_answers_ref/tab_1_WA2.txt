The table shows the quantile values of the Chi-squared distribution based on degrees of freedom and the level of significance. The image also illustrates the relationship between the p-value and the quantile value when the degrees of freedom exceed 50. With 10 degrees of freedom and a test value of 20, the test is not significant at a 5% significance level, as the quantile value is 22.31. Thus, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
