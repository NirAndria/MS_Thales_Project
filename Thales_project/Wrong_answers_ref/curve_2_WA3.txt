The graph illustrates time in seconds on the horizontal axis and current in milliamperes on the vertical axis. The current fluctuates erratically until 52 seconds. It then decreases slowly, reaching a low of -1.75 milliamperes at 62 seconds. Afterward, the current rises to 0.9 milliamperes at 70 seconds before sharply increasing to 5 milliamperes, where it continues to rise unpredictably.
