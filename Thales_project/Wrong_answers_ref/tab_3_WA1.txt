The image presents two tables, each with five columns. The tables have three common columns: Key1, Key2, and Key3.  If we performed a left join considering the columns Key1 and Key2 from both tables and averaged Value1 and Value2 for the same pairs of Key1 and Key2, the mean column for Key1 = 10 and Key2 = 110 would be 75.
