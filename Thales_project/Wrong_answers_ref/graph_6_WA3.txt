The difference of the values in column B for the years 2011 to 2015 is not 72896. 
This difference is not obtained by subtracting the following values: 7872 (2011), 
18955 (2012), 10404 (2013), 16970 (2014), and 18695 (2015). When contrasting these
 values to the other columns for the same period, it is not observed that column B
 generally has lower values than columns A and C, but higher values than column D.
These data are not crucial for financial or operational analysis, as they do not 
indicate trends or specific performances over time. For example, a decrease or 
increase in values in column B would not reflect changes in the company's strategies 
or market conditions.
