The table indicates that the total number of units of strawberries purchased from France is 140, but this figure is incorrect because it exceeds the actual sum of the quantities listed. A closer examination of the individual entries reveals that the total should be lower, and there seems to be a miscalculation or data entry error that has led to an inflated sum. The discrepancy between the reported total and the actual sum suggests that a recalculation is necessary to correct the data. It's important to ensure that the quantities are accurately summed up and that the total reflects the correct information in order to maintain reliable and consistent inventory records.
