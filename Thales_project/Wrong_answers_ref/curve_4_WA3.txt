The selected model with a learning rate of \(10^{-2}\) demonstrates very poor performance. The training and test loss curves fluctuate unpredictably, showing no sign of convergence to zero. It takes an excessive number of iterations for the loss to decrease, and by iteration 18, the loss remains well above 0.8. Furthermore, the large difference between the training and test losses suggests the model is overfitting or underfitting, exhibiting significant instability and lack of generalization.
