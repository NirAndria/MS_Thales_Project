Over the three decades shown, the Antarctic ozone loss remains relatively high and steady, with slight variations around the 50% mark. The Arctic, however, displays a more dynamic pattern, with notable peaks around the years 1996, 2004, 2012, and 2020. These peaks suggest that the Arctic ozone layer is subject to more frequent and dramatic fluctuations, possibly due to varying atmospheric conditions or external factors affecting the region. The stability in the Antarctic data could be attributed to the consistent presence of the ozone hole, which is a well-documented phenomenon in that region.
