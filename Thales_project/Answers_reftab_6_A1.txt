The brand Maserati experienced the most significant percentage decrease in sales between January 2021 and January 2022, with a decline of 80.00%. This substantial drop can be attributed to several factors, including an ineffective marketing strategy, increased competition in the luxury vehicle market, or internal company issues. The implications for Maserati could include a loss of market share, reduced investment in research and development, and a need to revise their business strategy to reposition themselves in the market.
