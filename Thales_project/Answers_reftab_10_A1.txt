It is stated that France has the highest total price for apples, and this statement is correct when we calculate the total price by summing the products of the units and the price per unit for apples from France. The total price can be calculated using the following formula:
(36 units×25.2)+(29 units×23.85)+(17 units×22.63)+(12 units×26.8)(36 \, \text{units} \times 25.2) + (29 \, \text{units} \times 23.85) + (17 \, \text{units} \times 22.63) + (12 \, \text{units} \times 26.8)(36units×25.2)+(29units×23.85)+(17units×22.63)+(12units×26.8)
This calculation reflects the total cost of apples purchased from France, taking into account both the quantity of apples and their respective prices. By multiplying the units purchased by the price per unit, we can determine the total expenditure for each type of apple, and summing these gives the overall total. This total price is the highest when compared to other countries, confirming France's position at the top in terms of apple expenditure.
