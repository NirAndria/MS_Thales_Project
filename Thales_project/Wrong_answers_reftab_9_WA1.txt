The total number of units of strawberries purchased from France is reported as 120, but this figure is incorrect, as it does not align with the sum of the quantities listed. Upon reviewing the individual purchase entries and their respective quantities, it becomes evident that the total does not accurately reflect the actual sum of units. This discrepancy suggests a calculation error, data entry mistake, or misinterpretation of the recorded quantities. A more detailed verification of the data is necessary to ensure the total number of units is correctly calculated and matches the sum of the quantities recorded. The current mismatch indicates that further attention is needed to resolve the issue and maintain accurate inventory records.
