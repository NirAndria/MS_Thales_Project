            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if these two texts have the same overall meaning, ignoring differences in style or length but checking for contradictions or non-identical shared info.\n\nFirst text: They break down steps to find strawberries from France. They list three entries: 37, 91, and 17 units. Summing them gives 145. The answer is 145.\n\nSecond text: States the total is 130, calculated by adding 37 and 91, which equals 130. They mention including all entries to avoid errors, but they only added two numbers. The result here is 130.\n\nSo, the first text adds three numbers (37+91+17=145), the second adds two (37+91=130). The totals are different (145 vs 130), which is a contradiction. Even though both talk about strawberries from France and similar steps, the actual numbers summed are different, leading to different totals. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if these two texts have the same overall meaning. The first text breaks down the calculation step by step, identifying rows where the product is strawberries from France. It lists three entries: 37, 91, and 17 units, which add up to 145. The second text states that the total is 130 units from France. The key point here is the total number. The first says 145, the second says 130. Those numbers are different, so even though both are talking about summing strawberry units from France, the totals contradict each other. Since the totals don't match, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",

            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if these two texts have the same overall meaning. The first text explains how to calculate the total units of strawberries from France by adding 37, 91, and 17, resulting in 145. The second text says the reported total is 120, which is incorrect because it doesn't match the sum of the entries. The first one says the correct sum is 145, while the second points out that 120 is wrong. Since one claims 145 and the other says 120 is incorrect, they are contradictory. So the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if these two texts have the same overall meaning. The first text breaks down the calculation step by step, identifying rows with strawberries from France, summing 37, 91, and 17 to get 145. The second text says the total reported is 140 but claims it's incorrect because the actual sum should be lower, pointing out a miscalculation.\n\nWait, the first text's sum is 145, but the second text mentions the total is 140 and says that's too high. But according to the first calculation, the correct sum is 145, which is higher than 140. However, the second text argues that the actual sum should be lower than 140, implying that 140 is an overcount. But in reality, if the correct sum is 145, then 140 would be an undercount, not overcount. The second text says the reported total (140) exceeds the actual sum, which would mean the actual sum is less than 140. But the first text's actual sum is 145, which is more than 140. So there's a contradiction here. The first text says the correct total is 145, the second says the reported 140 is too high, but in reality, the correct sum is higher. Therefore, the two texts contradict each other. So the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",

The second text says the stated total is 120, which is incorrect because the sum doesn't match the actual entries.\n\nSo, the first text concludes 145, the second says the stated total is wrong (120) and that the correct sum isn't matching. The key point here is whether the overall message is the same. The first text is providing a calculation leading to 145. The second is pointing out that the stated total (120) is wrong, implying the correct sum is different. However, the second text doesn't explicitly state the correct total, just that 120 is incorrect. The first text's main message is the correct total is 145. The second's main message is that 120 is wrong. Since they are talking about different totals (145 vs. 120 being incorrect), the overall meaning isn't the same. The first gives a correct calculation, the second points out an error in a different total. Therefore, they don't have the same overall meaning because they refer to different totals and one corrects an error while the other provides a correct sum. So the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno"
