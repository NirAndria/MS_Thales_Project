Nigeria's population is 223M, Mozambique 100M, Congo 80M. The order mentioned is Nigeria first, then Mozambique, then Congo. But in the first text's ordered list, after Nigeria and Ethiopia comes Congo, then Uganda, Mozambique, etc. So in the first list, Congo is third, Mozambique is fifth. But in the second text, Mozambique is second, Congo third. That's a contradiction in the order. Also, the second text doesn't mention Ethiopia, Uganda, Somalia, Niger. So the shared info (Nigeria, Mozambique, Congo) has different order, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",

It mentions Nigeria first, then Mozambique, then Congo. \n\nWait, the first text's ordered list after filtering is Nigeria, Ethiopia, Congo, Uganda, Mozambique, Somalia, Niger. But the second text's order is Nigeria, Mozambique, Congo. That's a contradiction in the order. Also, the second text doesn't mention Ethiopia, Uganda, Somalia, Niger. So the second text's list is shorter and in a different order. Since the first text's final order is by descending population, but the second text's order after Nigeria is Mozambique (100M) before Congo (80M), which is correct. But the first text's order after Nigeria is Ethiopia (which isn't mentioned in the second text), then Congo, Uganda, etc. So the second text skips Ethiopia and others. That's a contradiction because the first text includes them, the second doesn't. Therefore, the shared info isn't identical. So answer is no.\n</think>\n\nno",

However, the second text lists Mozambique as next after Nigeria, which contradicts the order in the first text. Also, Congo's population in the second text is 80 million, which would place it after Ethiopia (if Ethiopia's population is higher than 80 million). But the first text's order is Nigeria, Ethiopia, Congo, Uganda, Mozambique... So if the second text says Mozambique is next after Nigeria, that's a contradiction in the order.

But the second text lists Nigeria, Mozambique, Congo. That's a different order. Also, the first text includes seven countries, while the second only mentions three. \n\nBut the question is about overall meaning. The first text's main point is the list of countries meeting criteria, ordered by population. The second text provides data for three countries, but the order here is Nigeria, Mozambique, Congo. In the first list, after Nigeria and Ethiopia comes Congo, then Uganda, Mozambique. So Mozambique is fifth in the first list but second in the second text. That's a contradiction in the order. Also, the second text doesn't mention Ethiopia, Uganda, Somalia, Niger. So the shared info (Nigeria, Mozambique, Congo) isn't ordered the same. Since the order is part of the main requirement (descending population), the second text's order contradicts the first. Therefore, they don't have the same overall meaning.\n</think>\n\nno",

All these numbers are way higher than the 10,000 threshold.
