But if there's contradictory info, I should say no.\n\nFirst text: They're talking about finding the mean of Value1 and Value2 where Key1=10 and Key2=110. They find Value1=30 from the left table and Value2=30 from the right table. Average is (30+30)/2=30. So the result is 30.\n\nSecond text: It mentions doing an inner join on Key1 and Key2, then averaging Value1 and Value2 for the same keys. The result given is 25.\n\nWait, the first text says 30, the second says 25. Those are different numbers. Even if the process is similar, the final results contradict each other. So according to the instructions, if there's contradictory information, the answer is no. So they don't have the same overall meaning because the outcomes are different.\n</think>\n\nno",

But if there's contradictory info or non-identical shared info, I should say no.\n\nFirst text: They're talking about finding the mean for Key1=10 and Key2=110. Steps are to find rows with those keys in both tables, extract Value1 and Value2, then average them. They found Value1=30 and Value2=30, so average is 30. Result is 30.\n\nSecond text: The image has two tables. They do an inner join on Key1 and Key2, then average Value1 and Value2 for matching keys. The result given is 25 for the same keys.\n\nWait, the first text says the mean is 30, the second says 25. That's a direct contradiction. Even if the process is similar, the final numbers are different. So they can't have the same overall meaning because the results contradict each other. So the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",

But if there's contradictory info or non-identical shared info, I should say no.\n\nFirst text: It's about calculating the mean for Key1=10 and Key2=110. Steps involve finding rows with those keys in both tables, extracting Value1 and Value2 (both 30), averaging them to get 30.\n\nSecond text: Talks about two tables with Key1, Key2, Key3. Left join on Key1 and Key2, sum Value1 and Value2 for matching pairs. The mean for Key1=15 and Key2=120 is 75.\n\nWait, the keys are different: 10 vs 15, 110 vs 120. The mean results are 30 vs 75. So the specific keys and the calculated means are different. Even though both are about calculating a mean using Value1 and Value2 from joined tables, the actual key values and results are conflicting. So they have contradictory information. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",

Wait, the second text says \"compute the sum... the resulting mean\". Wait, maybe they're adding Value1 and Value2 and then taking the average? If sum is 60, then average would be 30. But the second text says the mean is 50. That contradicts. So the first text's result is 30, the second says 50. Contradictory info. So answer no.\n</think>\n\nno"
