            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the two texts have the same overall meaning, ignoring details, style, or length. But if there's contradictory info or any shared info isn't identical, answer \"no\".\n\nFirst text: Analyzes four models with learning rates 0.20, 0.10, 0.03, 0.01. Says 0.03 and 0.01 are best in stability, leading to smooth loss curves and good convergence. The top ones (0.20 and 0.10) have oscillations, especially 0.20 being worst.\n\nSecond text: Talks about the worst model being learning rate 10^2 (which is 100, not 0.20). Says loss curves diverge, don't approach zero, loss stays above 8 after 180 iterations, poor convergence, overfitting, and instability.\n\nWait, the first text's worst is 0.20 (which is 0.2), but the second text's worst is 10^2 (100). These are different learning rates. So the first text's worst model is 0.20, second's is 100. Contradicts each other. Also, the first text says 0.03 and 0.01 are best, second doesn't mention those. So the shared info (which model is worst) is contradictory. Therefore, answer is no.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the two texts have the same overall meaning, ignoring details, style, or length. But if there's contradictory info or non-identical shared info, answer \"no\". \n\nFirst, I'll read both texts carefully.\n\nThe first text is analyzing four models with different learning rates (0.20, 0.10, 0.03, 0.01). It says that 0.03 and 0.01 have the best stability with smooth loss curves, leading to good convergence and generalization. The other two (0.20 and 0.10) have oscillations and are unstable.\n\nThe second text talks about the worst model being the one with a learning rate of 10\u00b2 (which is 100, not 0.01). It mentions the loss curves diverge, never go below 8, and have a large gap between training and test loss, indicating poor stability.\n\nWait, the first text's worst models are 0.20 and 0.10. The second text's worst is 10\u00b2 (100). But 0.20 is 2e-1, which is different from 1e2. So the learning rates in question here are different. The first text's bad models are 0.20 and 0.10, while the second text's bad model is 100. That's a contradiction because they're referring to different learning rates as the worst. Also, the first text says 0.01 is good, but the second text's worst is 100, which is a much higher rate. So the information about which learning rate is worst is conflicting. Therefore, they have contradictory information. So the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",

The second text mentions a learning rate of 10\u00b2 (100), which is way higher. The first text's worst model was 0.20, but the second text's model is 100. So they're talking about different learning rates. The first text's conclusion is that 0.03 and 0.01 are best. The second text says 100 is the worst. These are different models. So the information is contradictory because they refer to different learning rates and opposite conclusions. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno"

The conclusion is that 0.03 and 0.01 (which is 10^-2) have the best stability, smooth loss curves, good convergence.\n\nSecond text: Talks about a model with learning rate 10^-2 (which is 0.01) having very poor performance, fluctuating loss curves, no convergence, high loss at iteration 18, overfitting/underfitting, instability.\n\nWait, the first text says 0.01 is good, the second says 10^-2 (same as 0.01) is bad. That's a direct contradiction. So even though they're talking about the same learning rate, the conclusions are opposite. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",

But if there's contradictory info or non-identical shared info, answer no.\n\nFirst text talks about analyzing four subplots with learning rates 0.20, 0.10, 0.03, and 0.01. It concludes that 0.03 and 0.01 (which is 10^-2) have the best stability, smooth loss curves, leading to good convergence and generalization.\n\nSecond text mentions a learning rate of 10^-2 (which is 0.01) and says it results in modest progress, slower convergence, loss not below 0.8 by iteration 18, discrepancy between training and test losses indicating instability and limited generalization. But the model isn't completely ineffective.\n\nWait, the first text says 0.01 (same as 10^-2) has good stability, smooth curves, effective convergence. The second text says 10^-2 has slower convergence, instability, limited generalization. That's conflicting. So the answer should be no because they contradict each other on the performance of the 0.01 learning rate model.\n</think>\n\nno",
