            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if these two texts have the same overall meaning, ignoring differences in style or length but checking for contradictions or non-identical shared info.\n\nFirst text: Steps to check significance at 5% level. DF=10, test value=20. Find critical value 18.31 in the table. Since 20 > 18.31, significant. Conclusion: yes, significant.\n\nSecond text: Mentions the Chi 2 table, degrees of freedom=10, test value=20, quantile=18.31. Says test is significant at 5%, so reject null. \n\nComparing both: Both have DF=10, test value=20, critical value 18.31, same conclusion to reject null (significant at 5%). The second text mentions p-value and quantiles when DF>100, but the first doesn't. However, the main points (DF, test value, critical value, conclusion) are the same. The extra info in the second text about DF>100 isn't contradictory, just additional. Since the shared info (steps and conclusion) are identical, and no contradictions, the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\nyes",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if these two texts have the same overall meaning, ignoring differences in style or length. But if there's contradictory info or any shared info isn't identical, I should say no.\n\nFirst text: It outlines steps to check significance at 5% level. Steps include finding df=10, test value=20, looking up critical value 18.31, comparing 20 > 18.31, so significant. Conclusion is yes, significant.\n\nSecond text: Mentions the table shows chi-squared quantiles based on df and significance level. Image shows p-value and quantile when df >100. Then states with df=10 and test value 20, it's significant at 5% because quantile is 18.31. So reject null.\n\nComparing both: Both have df=10, test value 20, critical value 18.31 at 5%, leading to rejection. The second text mentions an image about df>100, but that's extra info not in the first. However, the main conclusion and the numbers are the same. The steps vs. direct statement\u2014difference in style, but same conclusion. No contradictions in the shared info. So answer yes.\n</think>\n\nyes",

But if there's contradictory info or any shared info isn't identical, I should say no.\n\nFirst text: It's a step-by-step process. They mention degrees of freedom (df) = 10, test value = 20. They look up the critical value at 5% significance level in the Chi-Square table, which is 18.31. Since 20 > 18.31, they conclude it's significant, so reject the null. \n\nSecond text: Talks about the Chi-squared distribution table, mentions quantile values. For 10 df and test value 20, the quantile (critical value) is 18.31 at 5% significance. So they also say the test is significant, reject null. \n\nWait, both texts have the same df (10), same test value (20), same critical value (18.31), same conclusion (significant at 5%, reject null). The first one explains the steps in detail, the second is more concise but includes the same key points. They don't contradict each other. The shared info is identical. Even though the second mentions degrees of freedom exceeding 100 in the image, that's extra info not conflicting with the first. So yes, same overall meaning.\n</think>\n\nyes"

I need to determine if these two texts have the same overall meaning, ignoring differences in style or length but checking for contradictions.\n\nFirst text: Steps to check significance at 5% level. DF=10, test value=20. Critical value from table is 18.31. Since 20 > 18.31, it's significant, so reject null.\n\nSecond text: Says with DF=10 and test value=20, the test isn't significant at 5% because the quantile (critical value) is 22.31. So 20 < 22.31, fail to reject null.\n\nWait, the critical values here are different. First text says 18.31, second says 22.31. That's a contradiction. Even if one is correct and the other wrong, the conclusions are opposite. So the overall meaning is different because one says significant, the other not. So answer no.\n</think>\n\nno",
