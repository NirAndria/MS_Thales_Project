            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if these two texts have the same overall meaning, ignoring differences in style or length. But if there's contradictory information or any shared info that's not identical, I should say no.\n\nFirst text: The Department of the Interior has a budget of $29.20 billion, total budget is $4.7 trillion (4700 billion). Calculates 0.62%.\n\nSecond text: Says $12.50 billion allocated to the Department of the Interior, which is 3.76% of the total. Also mentions different total figures for mandatory spending and Defense.\n\nWait, the numbers here are conflicting. The first says $29.2B for Interior, the second says $12.5B. The percentages are also different: 0.62% vs 3.76%. The total budgets mentioned might differ too. The first total is $4.7T, but the second mentions $2.841T for mandatory and $750B for Defense. If those are parts of the total, maybe the total is higher? But the second text doesn't state the total explicitly. However, if the second text's 3.76% is based on a different total, then the numbers are conflicting. Since the Department of the Interior's amount and percentage are different, that's a contradiction. So the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",

The first says 29.2 billion leading to 0.62%, the second says 12.5 billion resulting in 3.76%. The dollar amounts and percentages are different. Even if the total budget was different, but in the first text the total is 4.7 trillion, and the second mentions mandatory spending and Defense as parts. But the key is the Department of the Interior's allocation. The numbers here are contradictory. So they can't have the same overall meaning because the figures don't match. So the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",

The first says 29.2 billion, the second 12.5 billion. The percentages are also different: 0.62% vs 3.76%. That's a contradiction in both the amount and the percentage. Even if the total budget was different, but in the first text the total is 4.7 trillion, and the second mentions mandatory spending as 2.841 trillion and Defense as 750 billion. Adding those two gives 3.591 trillion, but maybe the total is different here. However, the second text says 12.5 billion is 3.76% of the total. Let me check: 12.5 / 0.0376 \u2248 332.45 billion. That's way lower than 4.7 trillion. So the second text's total budget would be around 332.45 billion, which contradicts the first text's 4.7 trillion. \n\nTherefore, the numbers are conflicting. Even if the total budgets are different, the key info about the Department of the Interior's allocation is contradictory. So the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno"

Department of Interior has $29.20 billion. Total budget is $4.7 trillion (4700 billion). Calculates 0.62%.\n\nSecond text: The graph (maybe same as pie chart?) shows 2020 budget. Mentions Department of Interior gets $25 billion, which is 10.5% of total. \n\nWait, the numbers here are conflicting. First says $29.2B, second says $25B. The percentages are also different: 0.62% vs 10.5%. That's a big discrepancy. Also, the total budget in the first is $4.7T, but the second mentions discretionary spending as $1.2T and Health at $200B. If the total were $4.7T, those numbers would be parts of it, but the second text's total isn't directly stated. However, if the second text says $25B is 10.5%, then total would be 25 / 0.105 \u2248 $238.1B, which is way less than $4.7T. So the totals are conflicting. Also, the units in the first are billions and total in trillions, while the second mentions amounts in millions but then uses billions. The Department of Interior's allocation and percentage are different. Therefore, they have contradictory information. So the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",

But the second text says the total budget's percentage for Interior is 10%, which would require a total of 500 billion (since 50 is 10% of 500). But the first text's total is 4700 billion.
