            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring differences in detail, style, or length. But if there's contradictory information or any shared info isn't identical, I should answer 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, I'll look at Text 1. It breaks down the steps to calculate the total units of strawberries from France. They identify the rows with strawberries (Fraises) and sum the units from France. The numbers given are 37, 91, and 17, which add up to 145. So the conclusion is 145 units.\n\nNow Text 2 states the total is 130 units. They mention adding 37 and 91 to get 130. Wait, that's only two numbers instead of three. So Text 2 is missing the 17 units that Text 1 includes. That means the totals are different: 145 vs. 130. Even though both are talking about summing units from France for strawberries, the actual numbers don't match. Text 2's calculation is missing one of the entries, leading to a different total. Since the totals contradict each other, the answer should be 'no'.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not getting confused by the extra details in Text 2. The main point is the total number. Even if the process is similar, the result is different. Contradictory information means 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the two texts have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details like style or length. The key is whether they present contradictory information or if any shared info isn't identical.\n\nLooking at Text 1, it breaks down the steps to calculate the total units of strawberries from France. It lists three entries: 37, 91, and 17 units, summing to 145. The conclusion is 145 units.\n\nText 2 states the total is 130 units, also from summing entries for strawberries from France. It mentions checking entries and accuracy but ends up with 130.\n\nSo, both texts are about calculating the total units of strawberries from France by summing entries. However, the totals they arrive at are different: 145 vs. 130. Even though the method described is similar, the final numbers contradict each other. Since the totals are conflicting, the answer should be 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",

            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring differences in detail, style, or length. But if there's contradictory info or any shared info isn't identical, I should say 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, I'll read both texts carefully. \n\nText 1 is a step-by-step explanation. They identify rows where the product is strawberries (Fraises) from France. They list three entries: 37, 91, and 17 units. Summing those gives 145. So the conclusion is 145 units.\n\nText 2 says the reported total is 120, but that's incorrect. It mentions a discrepancy, suggesting a calculation error or data entry mistake. They advise checking the entries again. The key point here is that the total is wrong and the correct sum isn't provided, but the implication is that 120 isn't right.\n\nNow, comparing the two. Text 1 clearly states the total is 145. Text 2 says the reported total is 120, which is wrong. However, Text 2 doesn't provide the correct sum, just points out the error. But the main issue is that Text 1's answer (145) directly contradicts Text 2's mentioned reported total (120). Even though Text 2 is saying 120 is wrong, it doesn't confirm 145. But the key is that the two texts present different totals. Text 1 says 145, Text 2 refers to a reported 120 which is incorrect. The actual correct total in Text 1 is 145, but Text 2 doesn't state that. However, the semantic meaning here is about the total. Since Text 1 claims 145 and Text 2 refers to a different number (120) as incorrect, they are contradictory. Even if Text 2 is pointing out the error, the numbers themselves are conflicting. Therefore, the answer should be 'no'.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if the contradiction is explicit. Text 2 doesn't say the correct total is 145, just that 120 is wrong. But Text 1's conclusion is 145. So if Text 2 is saying that the reported 120 is incorrect, but doesn't provide the correct number, does that contradict Text 1? Since Text 1's 145 isn't mentioned in Text 2, but Text 2's context is that the correct total isn't 120. However, the user's instruction says if any shared information is not identical, answer 'no'. The shared information here is the total units. Text 1 says 145, Text 2 refers to a reported 120 (which is wrong). But the actual correct total in Text 1 is 145, which isn't mentioned in Text 2. However, the two texts are talking about the same subject (total units of strawberries from France) but present conflicting numbers. Therefore, they are contradictory. So the answer is 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details like style or length. They specifically mention that if there's contradictory information or if shared info isn't identical, the answer should be 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, I'll look at Text 1. It's a step-by-step explanation of calculating the total units of strawberries from France. They identify the rows, check the units, sum them up. The numbers given are 37, 91, and 17, which add up to 145. So Text 1 concludes the total is 145.\n\nNow Text 2 says the table reports the total as 140, but this is incorrect because the actual sum is lower. It mentions a miscalculation or data entry error leading to an inflated sum. The text advises a recalculation to correct the data.\n\nWait, Text 1 says the correct sum is 145. Text 2 says the table claims 140, which is wrong, and the actual sum should be lower. But if Text 1's correct sum is 145, then Text 2's assertion that the actual sum is lower than 140 is conflicting. Because 145 is higher than 140. So Text 2 is saying the total should be lower than 140, but Text 1's calculation shows it's 145. That's a contradiction. \n\nTherefore, the two texts have conflicting information about the total. Even though both are discussing the same topic (calculating strawberry units from France), their conclusions about the total are contradictory. Text 1 says 145, Text 2 implies the correct total is less than 140. So the answer should be 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the two texts have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details, style, or length. But if there's contradictory info or non-identical shared info, answer 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, read both texts carefully.\n\nText 1 is a step-by-step explanation. They identify rows where the product is strawberries from France. They list three entries: 37, 91, and 17 units. Summing them gives 145. The conclusion is that the total is 145.\n\nText 2 says the stated total is 120, but that's incorrect because the sum of the actual entries doesn't match. It mentions a discrepancy and possible errors. So, Text 2 is pointing out that the total should be different from 120, but doesn't provide the correct sum. However, Text 1 actually calculates the sum as 145. \n\nWait, Text 2 says the stated total is 120, which is wrong. But Text 1's conclusion is 145. So, Text 2 is arguing against 120, but Text 1 is presenting 145 as the correct answer. So, the key point here is whether the two texts agree on the total. Text 1 says 145, Text 2 says 120 is incorrect but doesn't state the correct number. However, the user's instruction says to check if they have contradictory information or if shared info isn't identical. \n\nIn Text 1, the total is 145. Text 2 says that 120 is incorrect. The shared information here is the total number of units. Text 1's total (145) contradicts Text 2's mentioned incorrect total (120). But Text 2 doesn't explicitly state the correct total, only that 120 is wrong. However, if Text 2 is implying that the correct total is different from 120, and Text 1 provides a different total (145), then they are in agreement that 120 is wrong. But does that mean their semantic meaning is the same? Wait, the question is whether the two texts have the same semantic meaning. \n\nWait, the main point of Text 1 is to calculate and state the total as 145. The main point of Text 2 is to point out that the stated total (120) is wrong. So, Text 1 is providing a correct calculation, while Text 2 is critiquing an incorrect total. The actual numbers here are different: 145 vs. 120. But Text 2 doesn't mention 145. However, the user's instruction says to ignore differences in detail, style, or length. But if there's contradictory information, answer 'no'.\n\nWait, the key is whether the shared information is identical. The shared information here is the total units. Text 1 says 145, Text 2 refers to a 120 total as incorrect. Since 145 and 120 are different, and Text 2 is saying that 120 is wrong, but Text 1 is providing 145 as correct, then they are not contradictory in their stance (both agree 120 is wrong), but the actual totals they present are different. However, Text 2 doesn't state the correct total, only that 120 is wrong. So, the contradiction is between Text 1's 145 and the 120 mentioned in Text 2. But since Text 2 is saying 120 is incorrect, and Text 1 is providing a different number, they are not contradicting each other. Wait, but the user's instruction says if any shared information is not identical, answer 'no'. So, if both texts are talking about the total units, and one says 145 and the other says 120 is wrong (but doesn't state the correct one), is there a contradiction? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the shared information is that the correct total is not 120. Text 1 provides 145 as the correct total. Text 2 says 120 is incorrect. So, they both agree that 120 is wrong, but Text 1 gives a specific correct number. Since the user's question is whether the semantic meaning is the same, ignoring style, etc. But if the actual numbers differ, even if one is correct and the other is pointing out an error, then the answer would be 'no' because the information about the total is contradictory. Because Text 1's conclusion is 145, and Text 2 is saying that the stated total (120) is wrong. But Text 2 doesn't confirm 145. However, the user's instruction says if any shared information is not identical, answer 'no'. So, if both texts are about the total units from France for strawberries, and one says 145 and the other says 120 is incorrect, but doesn't provide the correct number, is there a contradiction? \n\nWait, the problem is that Text 2 is pointing out that 120 is incorrect, but doesn't state what the correct total is. Text 1 provides the correct total as 145. So, the shared information here is the subject (total units of strawberries from France). Text 1's answer is 145, Text 2's context is that 120 is wrong. Since 145 and 120 are different, and Text 2 is saying 120 is incorrect, but Text 1 is providing a different number, they are not contradicting each other. However, the user's instruction says if any shared information is not identical, answer 'no'. So, if the totals are different, even if one is correct and the other is incorrect, but they are different, then the answer is 'no'. Because the shared information (the total) is not identical. \n\nWait, but Text 2 doesn't state the correct total. It just says 120 is wrong. So, the shared information is that the total is not 120. Text 1 says the total is 145. So, they both agree that 120 is wrong, but Text 1 provides the correct number. However, the user's instruction says to ignore differences in detail, style, or length. So, if the core semantic meaning is that the total is not 120, then maybe they agree. But Text 1's main point is the correct total (145), while Text 2's main point is that 120 is wrong. Are these the same semantic meaning? Probably not. Because one is stating the correct total, the other is pointing out an error in a stated total. The actual information about the correct number is different. Therefore, the answer should be 'no' because the shared information (the total) is not identical. Text 1 says 145, Text 2 refers to 120 as incorrect. Since 145 and 120 are different, and the user's instruction says if any shared information is not identical, answer 'no', then the answer is 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno"
