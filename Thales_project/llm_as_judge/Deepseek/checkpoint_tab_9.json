The main thing is whether there's a contradiction or if the numbers are too far apart.\n\nIn Text 1, the total is 145. They added 37, 91, and 17. Text 2 says the total is 130, adding 37 and 91. Wait, Text 2 is missing the 17 units from one of the rows. So Text 1 includes three entries, while Text 2 only sums two. That means the totals are different: 145 vs. 130. The difference is 15 units. Since the numbers don't match and there's a discrepancy in the data summed, they contradict each other. Even if one rounds, 145 and 130 are more than just a rounding difference. So the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",

The main thing is whether they contradict each other.\n\nText 1 says the total is 145 units. It lists three entries: 37, 91, and 17, which add up to 145. Text 2 states the total is 130 units. The numbers here are different. Even if one text is more detailed, the actual totals are conflicting. Since 145 and 130 are not the same and aren't rounded versions of each other (like 130 vs 130.5 rounded down), this is a contradiction. So the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring differences in style or detail. The main thing is whether the key information is the same or if there's a contradiction.\n\nText 1 gives a step-by-step breakdown where they add three numbers: 37, 91, and 17. The sum is 145. Text 2 says the total is 130. So the totals are different. 145 vs. 130. That's a difference of 15. The question says if values are too far apart, answer no. What's considered \"too far\"? The examples mention rounding, so maybe if they were like 145 vs 140, that could be rounding. But 15 is a significant difference. Also, the numbers in Text 1 add up to 145, but Text 2 says 130. That's a direct contradiction in the totals. Even if one text is missing a row or miscounted, the totals are conflicting. So the answer should be no because the totals are contradictory.\n</think>\n\nno"

The main thing is whether they contradict each other or if the information isn't identical.\n\nText 1 calculates the total units of strawberries from France as 145 by adding 37, 91, and 17. It gives a step-by-step explanation and arrives at that number.\n\nText 2 says the reported total is 120 but points out that this is incorrect because it doesn't match the sum of the entries. It mentions a discrepancy and suggests there's an error, but doesn't provide the correct total. However, Text 1's total is 145, which is different from the 120 mentioned in Text 2. Even though Text 2 says the 120 is wrong, it doesn't state the correct sum. The key here is that Text 1's answer (145) contradicts the 120 in Text 2. Since Text 2 is pointing out that 120 is wrong but doesn't confirm 145, there's a contradiction in the numbers presented. Therefore, the answer should be no because the totals are conflicting.\n</think>\n\nno",

The main thing is whether they contradict each other or have non-identical info.\n\nText 1 calculates the total units of strawberries from France as 145 by adding 37, 91, and 17. Text 2 says the table reports 140 but claims that's incorrect because the actual sum is lower. Wait, Text 1's sum is 145, but Text 2 says the table says 140 and that the real sum should be lower. So Text 2 is pointing out that 140 is too high, but according to Text 1, the correct sum is 145, which is higher than 140. That's a contradiction. Because Text 2 says the correct total is lower than 140, but Text 1's correct total is 145, which is higher. So they contradict each other. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",

The main thing is whether there's a contradiction or if the numbers are too far apart.\n\nText 1 clearly states that the total units of strawberries from France are 145, calculated by adding 37, 91, and 17. Text 2 mentions that the stated total is 120 but points out that this is incorrect because the sum doesn't match the actual entries. However, Text 2 doesn't provide the correct total; it just says the 120 is wrong. \n\nWait, Text 1's total is 145, and Text 2 says the stated total is 120 but that's wrong. So Text 2 is saying the correct total isn't 120, but it doesn't give the right number. However, Text 1's 145 would be the correct sum if the entries are as listed. So Text 2 is contradicting the 120 figure, but Text 1 is providing a different number. Since Text 2 doesn't confirm 145 but just says 120 is wrong, there's a contradiction in the totals mentioned. The two texts are talking about different totals (145 vs. 120 being incorrect), so they contradict each other. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno"
