Contradictions or non-identical shared info mean 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'. Values can be rounded, partial info is okay. Only say 'no' if there's a contradiction or dates/values are too far apart.\n\nText 1 breaks down the temperature trends into periods: 1850-1900 (fluctuations, no clear trend), 1900-1940 (slight upward), 1940-1970 (variability, some cooling), 1970-2000 (pronounced upward), 2000-2023 (sharp rise). It mentions the \"global cooling\" period in mid-20th century. The overall message is a transition from natural variability to accelerating warming, especially post-1970s, due to human impact.\n\nText 2 mentions the graph includes four (actually five) measurements. It notes volatility but an overall increase, more pronounced since 1975. The key points are the general upward trend and a steeper increase from 1975 onward.\n\nComparing both: Both agree on the overall upward trend and a more significant rise starting around the 1970s (1970 vs 1975). Text 1 gives more detailed periods, including early 20th-century trends and mid-century cooling. Text 2 doesn't mention the early periods' fluctuations or the mid-century cooling. However, there's no contradiction here. The main point is the upward trend with acceleration post-1970s. The difference between 1970 and 1975 is minor (5 years) and within acceptable rounding. No conflicting information. So, they don't contradict each other. The answer should be 'yes'.\n</think>\n\nyes",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details like style or length. The key is to check for contradictions or non-identical shared information.\n\nText 1 breaks down the temperature trends into specific periods: 1850-1900 (fluctuations without a clear trend), 1900-1940 (slight upward trend), 1940-1970 (variability with some cooling), 1970-2000 (pronounced upward trend), and 2000-2023 (sharp rise). It mentions a transition from natural variability to accelerating warming, especially post-1970s.\n\nText 2 mentions the graph uses data from several sources and notes that while there are fluctuations, there's a general upward trend, more significant since 1975. \n\nComparing both, both agree on the overall upward trend and that the increase became more pronounced around the 1970s (1970 vs 1975). The exact start year (1970 vs 1975) is a difference, but the user said to ignore minor date differences if they're not too far. Since 1970 and 1975 are only five years apart, that's probably acceptable. Text 1 has more detailed periods, but Text 2 doesn't contradict those. Both mention fluctuations and the upward trend, especially post-1970s. No contradictions here. So the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\nyes",

Otherwise, 'yes'. \n\nText 1 breaks down the temperature trends into specific periods: 1850-1900 (fluctuations, no clear trend), 1900-1940 (slight upward), 1940-1970 (variability, some cooling), 1970-2000 (pronounced upward), and 2000-2023 (sharp rise). It mentions the \"global cooling\" period in mid-20th century and accelerating warming in the 21st.\n\nText 2 mentions the graph uses data from HadCRUT5, GISTEMP, NOAA, ECMWF, and Berkeley Earth. It states that despite variations, there's an overall rise, especially since 1975. \n\nComparing the two: Both agree on an upward trend, particularly from around the 1970s. Text 1 specifies different periods with varying trends, including a cooling period mid-century. Text 2 doesn't mention the cooling period or the early 20th-century trends. However, Text 2 does note that the upward trend is prominent since 1975, which aligns with Text 1's late 20th-century and onward description. \n\nAre there contradictions? Text 1's mention of a cooling period (1940s-1950s) isn't contradicted by Text 2, which just says there's variability but an overall rise. Since Text 2 doesn't address the mid-century cooling, there's no direct contradiction. The key points are the overall upward trend and the acceleration since the 1970s. Both texts agree on that. The absence of some details in Text 2 doesn't make them contradictory. Values and dates aren't conflicting; Text 2's \"since 1975\" is within Text 1's 1970-2000 period. So, no contradictions. They both convey the main idea of rising temperatures with a notable increase from the 70s onward. Therefore, the answer should be 'yes'.\n</think>\n\nyes"

            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the two texts have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details, style, or length. They said to answer 'no' if there's a contradiction or if dates/values are too far apart. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nLooking at Text 1: It's about global temperature anomalies from 1850 to 2023. It breaks down into periods with temperature trends\u2014fluctuations early on, slight warming in the early 20th century, some cooling mid-century, then a pronounced warming from the 70s onwards, accelerating in the 21st century. The main focus is on rising temperatures due to human activities and climate change.\n\nText 2: Describes a graph with months on the horizontal axis and local rainfall levels from three sources (NASA, METAR, NOAA). It states rainfall levels are stable but overall decreasing over the years, especially since 1980. The key points here are rainfall decreasing, not temperature, and the time frame mentioned is since 1980.\n\nComparing the two: Text 1 is about increasing global temperatures, while Text 2 is about decreasing rainfall. The subject matter is different\u2014temperature vs. rainfall. Even though both might relate to climate change, the specific data they discuss are contradictory in terms of what's being measured (temperature rise vs. rainfall decrease). Also, the time frames and variables are different. Text 1 spans 1850-2023 with specific periods, Text 2 mentions a general decrease with a notable drop since 1980. Since they're talking about different metrics (temperature vs. rainfall) and the trends are opposite in nature (upward vs. downward), they contradict each other in the information presented. Therefore, the answer should be 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",

The main point is a clear upward trend, especially post-1970s.\n\nText 2 describes a graph with months on the horizontal axis and local temperature fluctuations. It cites data sources like NOAA, METAR, NASA. It states a general downward trend, more pronounced since 1980. Wait, that's conflicting. Text 1 says upward, Text 2 says downward. Also, Text 1 is about global temperature anomalies, while Text 2 mentions local fluctuations. But the user said to ignore differences in detail like local vs global, but the trends are opposite. Even if one is local and the other global, the trends are contradictory. Since the answer should be 'no' if there's a contradiction, even if other info is partial, the answer here is no.\n</think>\n\nno",

Text 2 mentions an overall decline, especially since 1980. That's a direct contradiction. Text 1 is about warming (upward), Text 2 says decline (downward). So they contradict each other. Even if other parts might align, the main trend is opposite. So answer 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno"
