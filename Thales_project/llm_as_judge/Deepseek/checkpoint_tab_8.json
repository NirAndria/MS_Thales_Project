            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details like style or length. The main thing is whether there's a contradiction or if key information doesn't match.\n\nText 1 says that in row C8, the client is \"Madame\" living in LE MAS. Text 2 mentions client ID C8 is Madame Tatouille Laura, residing in LE MAS. The key points here are the client ID (C8), the residence (LE MAS), and the client's name. \n\nIn Text 1, the client is just referred to as \"Madame,\" while Text 2 gives a full name \"Madame Tatouille Laura.\" The question is whether these are considered the same. Since \"Madame\" is a title and \"Tatouille Laura\" is the full name, they might be referring to the same person, but the names aren't identical. However, the instructions say to ignore partial information. But if one text has a full name and the other only a title, that could be a contradiction. Also, the client ID C8 and residence LE MAS match. \n\nThe problem is whether the difference in the name (Madame vs. Madame Tatouille Laura) is a contradiction. Since \"Madame\" is part of the full name in Text 2, but Text 1 doesn't provide the full name, does that count as a contradiction? The user said to answer 'no' if there's contradictory information or if shared info isn't identical. Here, the client's name in Text 2 is more specific. Since Text 1 only says \"Madame\" and Text 2 gives a full name, they might not be exactly the same. For example, \"Madame\" could be a title, but the full name includes a first and last name. This could be a contradiction because the names don't match exactly. Therefore, the answer should be 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details, style, or length. Contradictions or non-identical shared info mean 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'. \n\nText 1 says the client in LE MAS is Madame, found in row C8. Text 2 mentions Madame Tatoille Laura, client ID C8, living in LE MAS, with civil status Madame, last name Tatouille, first name Laura. \n\nSo, both agree that the client in LE MAS is Madame, with ID C8. But Text 2 adds more details: full name (Tatouille Laura) and civil status. Text 1 just says Madame. Since the core information (Madame in LE MAS, C8) is the same, and the extra details in Text 2 don't contradict Text 1, they should be considered the same. The values aren't contradictory, just more detailed. So answer 'yes'.\n</think>\n\nyes",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details like style or length. The key points are whether there's any contradiction or if the shared info isn't identical.\n\nText 1 says the client in row C8 with Client_ville \"LE MAS\" is \"Madame\". Text 2 mentions the client with ID C8 is Madame Laura Tatoille, residing in LE MAS. \n\nSo, Text 1 refers to the client as \"Madame\" without a full name, while Text 2 gives the full name \"Madame Laura Tatoille\". The question is whether omitting the last name in Text 1 makes it contradictory or non-identical. Since Text 1's info is partial but not conflicting (as \"Madame\" could be part of the full name), and there's no contradiction in the residence or ID, they don't contradict. The values (C8, LE MAS) are the same. The answer should be yes because there's no contradiction, just more detail in Text 2.\n</think>\n\nyes"

            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details like style or length. The key is to check for contradictions or non-identical shared information.\n\nText 1 says that the client in row C8 with Client_ville \"LE MAS\" is Madame. Text 2 talks about client ID C1, Monsieur Hochon Paul, living in AVIGNON and not in LE MAS. \n\nSo, Text 1 identifies Madame in C8 as living in LE MAS. Text 2 mentions a different client (C1, Monsieur) in AVIGNON, stating he doesn't live in LE MAS. There's no overlap in client IDs or names here. Text 1's answer is Madame in LE MAS, while Text 2 is pointing out that another client (C1) isn't in LE MAS. Since they refer to different clients and different locations without contradicting each other's specific information, but Text 2 says the answer (presumably referring to someone else) is incorrect. Wait, maybe Text 2 is saying that the answer (Madame in LE MAS) is incorrect because C1 is in AVIGNON. But Text 1's client is C8, not C1. So they are talking about different clients. Therefore, there's no direct contradiction because they refer to different individuals. However, if the question was about who lives in LE MAS, Text 1 says Madame (C8), and Text 2 says that C1 doesn't live there. Since they are different clients, there's no contradiction. But maybe the answer in Text 2 is implying that the correct answer isn't Madame, but that's not stated. Wait, Text 2 says \"this answer is incorrect,\" but it's unclear which answer it's referring to. If Text 2 is stating that Monsieur Hochon Paul (C1) is not in LE MAS, which is correct, but Text 1 is about Madame (C8) being in LE MAS. So unless there's a contradiction where both can't be true, but since they are different clients, both can coexist. Therefore, the semantic meaning isn't the same because they refer to different clients and different residences. But the user's instruction says to answer 'no' if there's contradictory information or shared info isn't identical. Since they don't share the same client info and there's no direct contradiction (they're different entries), maybe the answer is 'no' because the shared information (about LE MAS) is handled differently. Wait, Text 1 says someone is in LE MAS, Text 2 says someone else isn't. They don't contradict each other because they're different people. So maybe the answer is 'yes' because there's no contradiction. Wait, but the user says to answer 'no' if any shared information is not identical. The shared info here is the residence LE MAS. Text 1 says a client is there, Text 2 says another client isn't. Since they are different clients, the shared info about LE MAS isn't conflicting. Therefore, the answer would be 'no' only if the same client is mentioned with conflicting info. Since they are different clients, there's no contradiction. So the answer should be 'yes'? Wait, but the user's instruction says to answer 'no' if \"any shared information is not identical\". If the shared information is about LE MAS, but in Text 1 it's associated with Madame (C8), and in Text 2, it's mentioned that C1 is not in LE MAS. Since they are different clients, the information about LE MAS isn't conflicting. Therefore, the shared information (existence of LE MAS as a residence) is the same. But the actual answer about who resides there is different. However, the user says to ignore differences in detail, style, or length. The main point is whether the semantic meaning is the same. If the question was \"Who lives in LE MAS?\", Text 1 says Madame, Text 2 says someone else doesn't. So they are not the same answer, hence different semantic meanings. Therefore, the answer is 'no' because they provide different answers regarding the client in LE MAS. Text 1 says it's Madame, Text 2 says another client isn't, which could imply that the correct answer is someone else, but that's not stated. However, the presence of contradictory information would be if Text 2 says that the client in LE MAS is not Madame. But Text 2 doesn't mention Madame. It just says that Monsieur Hochon Paul (C1) is not in LE MAS. So unless there's an implicit contradiction, but since they are different clients, there's no direct contradiction. Therefore, the answer is 'no' because the information about the client in LE MAS is different. Wait, but Text 1's answer is Madame in LE MAS, and Text 2 is pointing out that another client isn't there. If the original question was \"Who lives in LE MAS?\", then Text 1 gives an answer, and Text 2 says that another person isn't. But the semantic meaning of the two texts isn't the same because one is providing an answer, and the other is correcting a different answer. Therefore, they don't have the same meaning. So the answer is 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring differences in detail, style, or length. If there's a contradiction or non-identical shared info, answer 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'. \n\nText 1 says that the client in LE MAS is Madame, found in row C8. Text 2 states that Madame Audine Anne (client ID C2) lives in AIGUINES, not LE MAS. So, Text 1 claims Madame is in LE MAS (C8), while Text 2 says a different Madame (Audine Anne, C2) is in AIGUINES. These are conflicting because one says Madame is in LE MAS, the other says a specific Madame is not. Therefore, they contradict each other.\n</think>\n\nno",

If there's a contradiction or non-identical shared info, answer 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nText 1 says that the client in LE MAS is Madame, found in row C8. Text 2 talks about client C3, Madame Rouana Marie, living in ARLES, not LE MAS. So, Text 1 claims Madame is in LE MAS (C8), while Text 2 says Madame Rouana Marie is in ARLES (C3). These are different clients (different IDs and locations). Therefore, they contradict each other. Answer 'no'.\n\nWait, but Text 1 just says \"Madame\" without a full name. Could they be the same person? Unlikely, since the IDs are different (C8 vs C3) and locations are different (LE MAS vs ARLES). So, the information contradicts. So the answer is 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno"
