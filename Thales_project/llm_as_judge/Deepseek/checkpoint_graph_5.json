            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details, style, or length. They specifically mention that if there's contradictory information or if shared info isn't identical, the answer should be 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both texts thoroughly.\n\nText 1 outlines a process to find African countries with energy consumption between 1,000 kWh and 10,000 kWh and clean cooking access below 40%, then orders them by descending population. The steps are:\n\n1. Identify African countries in the energy range: Nigeria, Ethiopia, Uganda, Mozambique, Congo, Somalia, Niger.\n2. Filter those with clean cooking below 40%: same list as step 1.\n3. Order by descending population: Nigeria, Ethiopia, Congo, Uganda, Mozambique, Somalia, Niger.\n\nThe final list is Nigeria, Ethiopia, Congo, Uganda, Mozambique, Somalia, Niger.\n\nText 2 provides specific data for three countries: Nigeria (223M, 4,400 kWh, 18%), Mozambique (100M, 4,000 kWh, 5%), and Congo (80M, 4,100 kWh, 37%). These are presented in order of population: Nigeria first, then Mozambique, then Congo.\n\nNow, comparing the two. Text 1 lists seven countries in a specific order. Text 2 only mentions three. The user says to ignore differences in length, so the fact that Text 2 has fewer countries isn't a problem. But we need to check if the information that is shared is contradictory.\n\nLooking at the three countries in Text 2: Nigeria, Mozambique, Congo. In Text 1's ordered list, the order is Nigeria (1st), Ethiopia (2nd), Congo (3rd), Uganda (4th), Mozambique (5th), etc. But in Text 2, after Nigeria comes Mozambique (100M), then Congo (80M). However, in Text 1, Mozambique is 5th with a population lower than Congo's 80M? Wait, no. Wait, Text 1's order is Nigeria (highest), Ethiopia, Congo, Uganda, Mozambique, Somalia, Niger. So Congo is 3rd with higher population than Mozambique (5th). But in Text 2, Mozambique is listed as 100M population, which would be higher than Congo's 80M. That's a contradiction. Because in Text 1, Congo comes before Mozambique in the population order, implying Congo's population is higher than Mozambique's. But Text 2 says Mozambique has 100M and Congo 80M, which would mean Mozambique should come before Congo. This is a direct contradiction in the population order. Therefore, the shared information (the order of Mozambique and Congo) is not identical. So the answer should be 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details, style, or length. They care about contradictory info or non-identical shared info.\n\nFirst, Text 1 lists steps to filter African countries by energy consumption (1k-10k kWh) and clean cooking access below 40%, then orders them by population. The final list is Nigeria, Ethiopia, Congo, Uganda, Mozambique, Somalia, Niger.\n\nText 2 gives specific stats for Nigeria, Mozambique, and Congo. Nigeria's population is 223M, Mozambique 100M, Congo 80M. The order here is Nigeria first, then Mozambique, then Congo. But in Text 1's ordered list, after Nigeria and Ethiopia comes Congo, then Uganda, Mozambique, etc. So in Text 1, Mozambique is fifth, but in Text 2, Mozambique is second. That's a contradiction in the order. Also, Text 2 doesn't mention Ethiopia, Uganda, Somalia, Niger. So the lists don't match. Therefore, the answer should be 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",

Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both texts thoroughly. \n\nText 1 outlines a process to identify African countries with energy consumption between 1,000 kWh and 10,000 kWh and clean cooking access below 40%, then orders them by descending population. The steps are:\n\n1. List African countries in the energy range: Nigeria, Ethiopia, Uganda, Mozambique, Congo, Somalia, Niger.\n2. Filter those with clean cooking access below 40%: same list remains.\n3. Order by population descending: Nigeria, Ethiopia, Congo, Uganda, Mozambique, Somalia, Niger.\n\nThe final list is Nigeria, Ethiopia, Congo, Uganda, Mozambique, Somalia, Niger.\n\nText 2 provides specific data for Nigeria, Mozambique, and Congo. It mentions their population, energy consumption, and clean cooking access percentages. For example, Nigeria has 223 million, 4,400 kWh, 18%; Mozambique has 100 million, 4,000 kWh, 5%; Congo has 80 million, 4,100 kWh, 37%.\n\nNow, comparing the two texts. Text 1's final list includes seven countries, ordered by population. Text 2 only mentions three countries: Nigeria, Mozambique, Congo. The order in Text 2 is Nigeria first, then Mozambique, then Congo. But according to Text 1's order, after Nigeria comes Ethiopia, then Congo. However, in Text 2, after Nigeria, it's Mozambique next, then Congo. That's a contradiction in the order. \n\nAdditionally, Text 1 includes Ethiopia, Uganda, Somalia, and Niger in the list, but Text 2 doesn't mention these at all. So, Text 2 only provides details on three countries, whereas Text 1's final list has seven. This could be a difference in detail, but the user says to ignore differences in detail or length. However, the problem arises with the order. Since Text 2 lists Mozambique before Congo, but Text 1 has Congo after Ethiopia, which isn't mentioned in Text 2, this creates a contradiction in the shared information about the order. \n\nMoreover, Text 2's data for Congo's population is 80 million, but in Text 1's ordered list, Congo is third after Ethiopia. If Ethiopia's population is higher than Congo's, then in Text 1, Ethiopia would have a higher population than Congo. But Text 2 doesn't mention Ethiopia, so we can't confirm. However, the presence of Ethiopia in Text 1's list but not in Text 2's could be a contradiction if Text 2 is supposed to be a subset. But the user says to ignore differences in detail or length. However, the ordering of the countries that are mentioned in both texts (Nigeria, Mozambique, Congo) is different between the two texts. In Text 1, after Nigeria comes Ethiopia, then Congo. In Text 2, after Nigeria comes Mozambique, then Congo. This is a direct contradiction in the order of the countries mentioned. \n\nTherefore, even though Text 2 might be providing more detailed data for three countries, the order in which they are presented conflicts with Text 1's order. Since the user specifies that if any shared information is not identical, the answer is 'no', this contradiction in the order of Mozambique and Congo relative to each other and the absence of Ethiopia in Text 2's list (which is part of Text 1's ordered list) would mean the answer is 'no'.\n\nAnother point: Text 1's final ordered list is Nigeria, Ethiopia, Congo, Uganda, Mozambique, Somalia, Niger. Text 2 lists Nigeria, Mozambique, Congo. The order of Mozambique and Congo in Text 2 is Mozambique before Congo, but in Text 1, Congo comes before Mozambique. That's a direct contradiction in the ordering of these two countries. Since the user says to check if shared information is identical, and the order is part of the information, this discrepancy means the answer is 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno"

But Text 2 says Mozambique has 100M and Congo 80M, which would mean Mozambique should come before Congo. This is a direct contradiction in the population order.

They specifically mention that if there's contradictory info or if shared info isn't identical, the answer should be 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both texts thoroughly.\n\nStarting with Text 1. It outlines a process to find African countries with energy consumption between 1,000 kWh and 10,000 kWh and clean cooking access below 40%, then orders them by descending population. The steps are:\n\n1. Identify African countries in the energy range. They list Nigeria, Ethiopia, Uganda, Mozambique, Congo, Somalia, Niger.\n2. Filter those with clean cooking access below 40%. The same countries remain.\n3. Order by descending population: Nigeria, Ethiopia, Congo, Uganda, Mozambique, Somalia, Niger.\n\nThe final list is those seven countries in that order.\n\nNow, Text 2 provides specific tuples for Mozambique, Congo, and Nigeria. Let's parse that:\n\n- Mozambique: population 5 million, energy 40,000 kWh, clean cooking 95%.\n- Congo: 8 million, 41,000 kWh, 63%.\n- Nigeria: 22 million, 44,000 kWh, 82%.\n\nWait a minute. In Text 1, Mozambique is included in the list. But in Text 2, Mozambique's energy consumption is 40,000 kWh, which is way above the 10,000 kWh upper limit specified in Text 1. Similarly, Congo's energy is 41,000 kWh, also way over. Nigeria's is 44,000 kWh. All three countries in Text 2 have energy consumption way higher than the 10,000 kWh threshold from Text 1. \n\nMoreover, Text 1 requires clean cooking access below 40%, but in Text 2, Mozambique has 95%, Congo 63%, Nigeria 82%\u2014all above 40%. So according to Text 2's data, these countries wouldn't meet the criteria set in Text 1. But in Text 1, they are included. That's a direct contradiction. \n\nSo, the key here is that Text 1 includes countries that, according to Text 2's data, shouldn't be included because their energy consumption and clean cooking access percentages are outside the specified ranges. Therefore, the information is contradictory. \n\nEven though Text 2 only mentions three countries, the data provided for those three directly conflicts with the criteria in Text 1. Since the user said to answer 'no' if there's any contradictory information or if shared info isn't identical, the answer here should be 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",

Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both texts thoroughly.\n\nText 1 is a step-by-step process to identify African countries with energy consumption between 1,000 kWh and 10,000 kWh and clean cooking access below 40%, then order them by descending population. The final list is Nigeria, Ethiopia, Congo, Uganda, Mozambique, Somalia, Niger.\n\nText 2 provides specific data for Nigeria, Mozambique, and Congo. Nigeria has 223 million population, 4,400 kWh, 18% access. Mozambique: 100 million, 4,000 kWh, 5%. Congo: 80 million, 4,100 kWh, 37%. \n\nNow, check if the information in Text 2 aligns with Text 1. \n\nIn Text 1, all seven countries are listed after filtering. Text 2 only mentions three countries. However, the question says to ignore differences in detail or length. So the fact that Text 2 has fewer countries might not matter if the ones mentioned are consistent. But wait, the problem states that if any shared information is not identical, answer 'no'. \n\nLooking at the order in Text 1 after sorting by population: Nigeria first, then Ethiopia, Congo, Uganda, Mozambique, Somalia, Niger. In Text 2, after Nigeria, Mozambique is mentioned next, then Congo. But according to Text 1's order, after Nigeria comes Ethiopia, then Congo, then Uganda, then Mozambique. So in Text 2, Mozambique is listed second, which contradicts Text 1's order where Mozambique is fifth. That's a contradiction in the ordering. \n\nAdditionally, Text 2's Congo has 37% access, which is below 40%, so that's okay. But the order is conflicting. Since the order is part of the semantic meaning (as per the steps in Text 1), the discrepancy in the sequence would mean the answer is 'no'. \n\nAlso, Text 2 doesn't mention Ethiopia, Uganda, Somalia, or Niger. But the user says to ignore differences in detail or length. However, if the shared info (the three countries mentioned) has contradictions, then it's a 'no'. The order here is contradictory. So even though Text 2 doesn't list all countries, the ones it does list are in a different order than Text 1's sorted list. Therefore, the answer should be 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno"
