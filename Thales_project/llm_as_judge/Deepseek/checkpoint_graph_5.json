            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details like style or length. The key is to check for contradictions or significant differences in values.\n\nFirst, Text 1 lists African countries with energy consumption between 1,000 and 10,000 kWh and clean cooking access below 40%, ordered by population. The countries listed are Nigeria, Ethiopia, Congo, Uganda, Mozambique, Somalia, Niger. The order after sorting by population is Nigeria first, then Ethiopia, Congo, Uganda, Mozambique, Somalia, and Niger.\n\nNow, looking at Text 2: It mentions Nigeria with 223 million, 4,400 kWh, 18% access. Then Mozambique with 100 million, 4,000 kWh, 5%, and Congo with 80 million, 4,100 kWh, 37%. \n\nWait, Text 2 only lists three countries: Nigeria, Mozambique, Congo. But Text 1 has seven countries. So the lists are different. Text 1 includes Ethiopia, Uganda, Somalia, Niger which aren't in Text 2. That's a contradiction because Text 2 omits several countries that Text 1 includes. Also, the order in Text 2 is Nigeria, Mozambique, Congo, whereas in Text 1, after Nigeria and Ethiopia comes Congo, then Uganda, etc. So the order in Text 2 doesn't match Text 1's order. Additionally, Text 2's Congo has 37% clean cooking access, which is below 40%, so that's okay. But the main issue is the missing countries and the order. Since Text 2 doesn't include all the countries from Text 1 and the order is different, there's a contradiction. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details like style or length. The key is to check for contradictions or non-identical shared info.\n\nFirst, Text 1 lists African countries with energy consumption between 1,000 and 10,000 kWh and clean cooking access below 40%, ordered by population descending. The countries listed are Nigeria, Ethiopia, Congo, Uganda, Mozambique, Somalia, Niger. The order after sorting is Nigeria first, then Ethiopia, Congo, Uganda, Mozambique, Somalia, Niger.\n\nLooking at Text 2, it mentions Nigeria, Mozambique, Congo in that order. The populations given are 223 million, 100 million, 80 million. The energy consumption values are 4,400, 4,000, 4,100 kWh. Clean cooking access is 18%, 5%, 37% respectively. \n\nWait, Text 2 only lists three countries, while Text 1 has seven. That's a discrepancy. Also, Text 1 includes Ethiopia, Uganda, Somalia, Niger which aren't mentioned in Text 2. Since Text 2 doesn't mention all the countries from Text 1, there's missing information. However, the user said to ignore partial information. But the problem is that Text 2's list is a subset of Text 1's, but the order in Text 2 is Nigeria, Mozambique, Congo. In Text 1, after Nigeria and Ethiopia, Congo is third. But in Text 2, Mozambique is second. That's a contradiction in the order. For example, in Text 1, Ethiopia is second, but Text 2 doesn't mention Ethiopia at all. So the order in Text 2 skips Ethiopia and places Mozambique second. That's a direct contradiction in the ordering. Therefore, the answer should be no because the ordering is conflicting and some countries present in Text 1 are omitted in Text 2, leading to contradictory information.\n</think>\n\nno",

The countries listed are Nigeria, Ethiopia, Congo, Uganda, Mozambique, Somalia, Niger. The order after sorting is Nigeria first, then Ethiopia, Congo, Uganda, Mozambique, Somalia, Niger.\n\nText 2 mentions Nigeria (223M, 4,400 kWh, 18%), Mozambique (100M, 4,000 kWh, 5%), and Congo (80M, 4,100 kWh, 37%). These three are presented in order of population descending: Nigeria, Mozambique, Congo. Wait, but in Text 1, after Nigeria and Ethiopia comes Congo, then Uganda, etc. So in Text 2, Mozambique is second, Congo third. But in Text 1, Ethiopia is second, then Congo third. That's a contradiction in the order. Also, Text 2 only lists three countries, while Text 1 has seven. So the lists are different. Also, the clean cooking access in Congo is 37% in Text 2, which is below 40%, so that's okay. But the problem is the order and the countries included. Since Text 1 includes more countries and the order of the ones mentioned in Text 2 doesn't match (Ethiopia isn't in Text 2), there's a contradiction.

Finally, they order by descending population: Nigeria, Ethiopia, Congo, Uganda, Mozambique, Somalia, Niger.\n\nNow, Text 2 mentions Mozambique, Congo, and Nigeria with energy consumption values of 40,000 kWh, 41,000 kWh, and 44,000 kWh respectively. Wait, those numbers are way higher than the 1,000-10,000 range in Text 1. Text 1's upper limit is 10,000, but Text 2's numbers are in the 40,000s. That's a big discrepancy. Also, Text 2's clean cooking access for Mozambique is 95, which is way above the 40% threshold in Text 1. So Mozambique in Text 2 wouldn't even pass the filter in Text 1. Similarly, Congo has 63% access, which is also above 40%, so it contradicts Text 1's filter. Nigeria's 82% access is also way over 40%. \n\nSo Text 2's data contradicts Text 1's criteria. Even though both mention some of the same countries, the actual values for energy consumption and clean cooking access are conflicting. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",
