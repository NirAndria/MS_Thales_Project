            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to know if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring differences in detail, style, or length. They also mention that if there's contradictory information or any shared info isn't identical, the answer should be 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, I need to read both texts carefully and compare their main points. Let's start with Text 1. It outlines a step-by-step process for determining if a Chi-Square test is significant at a 5% level. The steps are:\n\n1. Identify df (10) and test value (20).\n2. Use the Chi-Square table, find row 10 and column 0.05.\n3. The critical value is 18.31.\n4. Compare test value (20) to critical value (18.31). Since 20 > 18.31, it's significant.\n\nText 2 mentions that the table shows Chi-Square quantiles based on df and significance level. It states that with df=10 and test value=20, the test is significant at 5% because the quantile (critical value) is 18.31. They reject the null hypothesis.\n\nNow, checking for contradictions. Both texts agree on df=10, test value=20, critical value=18.31, 5% significance, and conclusion to reject the null (i.e., significant result). The steps in Text 1 are more detailed, but Text 2 condenses it. The key elements are the same: same numbers, same conclusion. There's no conflicting information here. Even though Text 2 mentions degrees of freedom exceeding 100 in the table description, that's additional info not present in Text 1, but since we're told to ignore differences in detail or length, that's okay. The core shared info (df=10, test value 20 vs critical 18.31 at 5%) is identical. So the answer should be 'yes'.\n</think>\n\nyes",

They also mention that if there's contradictory information or any shared info isn't identical, the answer should be 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, I'll read both texts carefully.\n\nText 1 is a step-by-step explanation of how to determine significance at a 5% level using a Chi-Square test. It lists four steps: identifying df and test value (df=10, test=20), locating the table row/column, finding the critical value (18.31), comparing test value (20) to critical value (18.31), concluding significance because 20 > 18.31.\n\nText 2 mentions the Chi-squared distribution table, quantile values, degrees of freedom (10), test value 20, and quantile value 18.31. It states the test is significant at 5% level, so they reject the null hypothesis.\n\nNow, checking for contradictions or non-identical shared info. Both texts agree on df=10, test value=20, critical value=18.31, 5% significance, and conclusion to reject null (since test value exceeds critical). Text 1's conclusion is \"significant at 5%\", which implies rejecting the null, same as Text 2's explicit statement. \n\nText 2 also mentions the table's illustration when df exceeds 100, but that's additional info not present in Text 1. However, the user says to ignore differences in detail or length. The core shared info (df, test value, critical value, conclusion) is identical. There's no contradiction in the shared parts. The extra info in Text 2 about df>100 doesn't conflict with Text 1's content. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'yes' because the essential information matches without contradictions.\n</think>\n\nyes",

The mention in Text 2 about degrees of freedom exceeding 100 and p-value might be extra info not in Text 1, but since the user says to ignore differences in detail or length, that's okay. The core information about df=10, test value 20 vs critical 18.31 leading to rejection is identical. No contradictions here. So the answer should be 'yes'.\n</think>\n\nyes"

            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to know if the two texts have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details, style, or length. But if there's contradictory info or any shared info isn't identical, the answer is 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, I need to read both texts carefully. \n\nText 1 is a step-by-step explanation of determining significance at a 5% level using a Chi-Square test. The steps are: find df=10 and test value=20, look up the critical value in the table (which they found as 18.31), compare test value (20) to critical value (18.31). Since 20 > 18.31, they conclude it's significant, so reject the null. Answer is \"Yes, the test is significant...\"\n\nText 2 says that with df=10 and test value=20, the test is NOT significant at 5% because the quantile (critical value) is 22.31. Therefore, they fail to reject the null. \n\nSo both texts are using the same df (10) and test value (20), but different critical values. Text 1 says critical value is 18.31, leading to significance. Text 2 says critical value is 22.31, leading to non-significance. \n\nThe key here is the critical value. If they have different critical values, then the conclusions are opposite. Even though the setup (df=10, test=20) is the same, the critical values differ. That's a contradiction in the shared information. Therefore, the answer should be 'no'.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there's a possible misunderstanding. For example, maybe one is using upper tail and the other lower? But in Chi-Square tests, the critical value is typically upper tail. So 18.31 vs 22.31. Let me confirm standard Chi-Square table values. For df=10 and 0.05 significance level, the critical value is indeed 18.307, which rounds to 18.31. So Text 1 is correct. Text 2 mentions a quantile of 22.31. Wait, maybe that's a typo? 22.31 might be for a different significance level, like 0.01. For df=10, the 0.01 critical value is 23.209. So 22.31 isn't matching. Alternatively, maybe df is different? But Text 2 says df=10. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, the two texts have conflicting conclusions based on different critical values. Hence, the answer is 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",

Since 20 > 18.31, it's significant, so they reject the null.\n\nText 2 says that with 10 df and test value 20, the test isn't significant at 5% because the quantile (critical) value is 22.31. Therefore, they fail to reject the null.\n\nWait, the critical values here are different. Text 1 says 18.31, Text 2 says 22.31. That's a direct contradiction. Even though both are talking about the same test, same df, same significance level, the critical values are different. So the conclusion is opposite: one says significant (reject null), the other says not significant (fail to reject). \n\nBut why the difference? Maybe a typo in the critical value? For a Chi-square distribution with 10 df and 0.05 significance level, the critical value is indeed 18.307, which rounds to 18.31. So Text 1 is correct. Text 2 mentions 22.31, which might be for a different significance level or df. For example, if the significance level was 0.01, the critical value for df=10 is about 23.21. But 22.31 isn't matching that. Alternatively, maybe df is higher. Wait, Text 2 also mentions that the image shows when df exceed 50. But the specific example given is df=10. So perhaps Text 2 has an error in the critical value. \n\nRegardless of the reason, the two texts present conflicting critical values and opposite conclusions. Therefore, the shared information (df=10, test value=20, 5% significance) leads to different results. So the answer should be 'no'.\n\nAnother angle: the user says to ignore differences in detail, style, or length. But contradictory info means 'no'. Here, the critical values and conclusions contradict each other. So even if the steps are similar, the key numerical values and outcomes differ. Thus, the answer is 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",

Therefore, they fail to reject the null.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. Text 1 says critical value is 18.31, leading to significance. Text 2 says critical value is 22.31, so test value 20 is below that, not significant. The conclusions are opposite. Even though both are about the same test, same df, same test value, the critical values they reference are different, leading to opposite results. That's a contradiction. So the answer should be 'no'.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I misread. Text 1's critical value at 5% is 18.31 for df=10. Text 2 says quantile value (which is the critical value) is 22.31 for df=10. That's a big difference. Why the discrepancy? Maybe a typo in one of the texts? But regardless, according to the problem statement, if there's contradictory information, answer 'no'. So even if one text is correct and the other isn't, the fact that they contradict means the answer is 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno"
