Both agree on all key values and the conclusion. Even though Text 2 mentions the table's structure and p-values for df over 100, that's extra info not conflicting.

            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details like style or length. The main thing is to check for contradictions or non-identical information.\n\nFirst, both texts are talking about a chi-squared test with 10 degrees of freedom and a test value of 20. They both mention a 5% significance level. In Text 1, the critical value is 18.31, and since 20 is greater than that, they conclude significance. Text 2 also states the quantile value (which is the critical value) is 18.31, leading to rejecting the null hypothesis at the 5% level. \n\nWait, Text 2 mentions the image shows quantiles when degrees of freedom exceed 100, but the example given is for 10 degrees. That part might be extra info not in Text 1, but the user said to ignore differences in detail or partial information. The key points are the same: df=10, test value 20, critical value 18.31, significant at 5%. No contradictions here. Both agree on the conclusion. So the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\nyes",

            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the two texts have the same semantic meaning, ignoring style or length. The key is to check for contradictions or major differences in values.\n\nText 1 says the critical value at 5% significance with df=10 is 18.31, and since the test value is 20 (which is higher), they reject the null. Text 2 states the quantile (critical value) is 22.31 for the same df and significance level, and since the test value is 20 (lower than 22.31), they don't reject the null. \n\nThe critical values here are conflicting: 18.31 vs. 22.31. That's a big difference. Even if one text rounds numbers, 18 vs. 22 is too far apart. This leads to opposite conclusions. So the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",
