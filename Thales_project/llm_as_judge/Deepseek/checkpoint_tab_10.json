            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring differences in style or detail. The main thing is to check for contradictions or non-identical shared information.\n\nFirst, Text 1 goes through a step-by-step process to calculate the total price for apples in different countries. It lists specific rows with data for Suisse, Belgique, France (three entries), and Espagne. The calculations for France in Row 14 give a total of 2204,24, which is the highest. The conclusion is that France (Row 14) has the highest total price.\n\nNow, Text 2 states that France has the highest total price by summing the products of units and price per unit. However, the numbers here are different. The formula mentions units like 36 units at 25.2, 29 units at 23.85, 17 units at 22.63, 12 units at 26.8. These numbers don't match the ones in Text 1. In Text 1, France's entries are 32 units at 16.41, 154 units at 14.36, and 66 units at 16.77. The values in Text 2 are higher in both units and price per unit. For example, 36 units vs. 32, 29 vs. 154, etc. The prices per unit in Text 2 are around 25-26, whereas in Text 1 they're around 14-16. \n\nThe totals calculated in Text 1 for France (Row 14) is 2204.24, but Text 2's calculation would be (36*25.2) + (29*23.85) + (17*22.63) + (12*26.8). Let me roughly compute that: 36*25 is 900, 29*24 is 696, 17*23 is 391, 12*27 is 324. Adding those gives around 900+696=1596, +391=1987, +324=2311. That's a rough estimate, but even so, the numbers are different from Text 1's 2204.24. However, the user said to ignore rounding, but the problem is that the units and prices per unit are entirely different. \n\nIn Text 1, France's entries are three rows (9,14,17) with specific data, while Text 2 seems to have four different entries for France with different numbers. This is a contradiction because the data points don't align. Even if both conclude France is highest, the underlying data is conflicting. Therefore, the answer should be no because the information shared is not identical and contains contradictions in the numbers used.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring differences in style or detail. The key is to check for contradictions or non-identical information.\n\nText 1 goes through a detailed process: identifying rows where the product is \"Pomme,\" extracting prices and units, calculating totals per country, and concluding that France (Row 14) has the highest total at 2204,24. It lists specific numbers for Suisse, Belgique, France (three entries), and Espagne.\n\nText 2 states that the highest total price for apples is from France, based on summing up the costs from the table entries for France. It mentions that the total is the highest when considering unit prices and quantities, and emphasizes accurate data recording.\n\nNow, do they agree? Text 1's conclusion is France (Row 14) with 2204,24. Text 2 says France's total is the highest when adding up all their entries. Wait, Text 1's calculation for France includes three separate rows (9, 14, 17), each calculated individually. The total for France in Text 1's step 4 lists each row's total, but the conclusion picks Row 14 (2204.24) as the highest. However, Text 2 says \"add up the cost of each apple unit from France\" which might imply summing all French entries. But in Text 1, the highest individual French entry is Row 14, not the sum of all French entries. So there's a contradiction here. Text 1 is looking at individual rows per country, while Text 2 might be aggregating all French entries. If Text 2 is referring to the sum of all French entries, then the total would be 523.52 + 2204.24 + 1102.72 = 3830.48, which is higher than Row 14 alone. But Text 1's conclusion is based on individual rows, not the sum per country. Therefore, Text 1 says the highest is a single French entry (Row 14), while Text 2 might be saying the sum of all French entries is the highest. That's a contradiction. So the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring differences in style or detail. The main thing is to check for contradictions or non-identical shared information.\n\nText 1 goes through a detailed process: identifying rows where the product is \"Pomme\" (Apple), extracting price per unit and units purchased for each relevant row, calculating total prices per country, and then comparing them. The conclusion is that France (specifically Row 14) has the highest total price of 2204,24.\n\nText 2 states that France's total price for apples is the highest when adding up all the apple units purchased from France. It mentions that the total cost from France exceeds others when multiplying unit price by quantity. It also notes the importance of verifying data accuracy.\n\nNow, checking for contradictions. Text 1 clearly shows that France's total (from Row 14) is the highest. Text 2 says France's total is the highest. Both agree on France being the highest. However, Text 1 breaks down France into three rows (9, 14, 17) and sums each individually, then picks Row 14's total. Text 2 refers to adding up all apple units from France. Wait, does Text 2 imply combining all France entries? Because in Text 1, France has three separate entries, each calculated individually. The highest single entry is Row 14's 2204,24, but if Text 2 is adding all France entries together, that would be 523,52 + 2204,24 + 1102,72 = 3830,48, which is much higher. But Text 2 says \"add up the cost of all the apple units purchased from France,\" which could mean summing all three, but Text 1's conclusion is based on individual rows, not the sum of all French entries. So there's a contradiction here. Text 1's highest is a single French row, while Text 2 might be aggregating all French purchases. If that's the case, then the conclusions differ. However, Text 2's wording is a bit ambiguous. It says \"add up the cost of all the apple units purchased from France,\" which could be interpreted as each transaction (rows 9,14,17) being separate, but the total for France would be the sum of those. But in Text 1, the conclusion is that the highest single transaction is in France (Row 14), not the sum of all French transactions. So if Text 2 is referring to the sum of all French transactions, then the answer would be different, leading to a contradiction. But Text 2 says \"the total cost for apples from France results in the highest overall price,\" which might mean that when you sum all French apple purchases, France has the highest total. However, in Text 1, the highest single entry is France's Row 14, but if you sum all French entries, the total would be higher than any other country's total. Let me check the numbers in Text 1. The other countries: Suisse has 1212,4; Belgique 197,4; Espagne 1060,46. France's total if summed: 523,52 + 2204,24 + 1102,72 = 3830,48. That's way higher than any other country. So if Text 2 is saying that France's total (sum of all French entries) is the highest, then Text 1's conclusion is wrong because Text 1's conclusion is based on individual rows, not the country's total. But wait, in Text 1, step 3 says \"calculate the total price for apples in each country by multiplying the price per unit by the number of units purchased.\" Then step 4 compares these totals. Wait, but in Text 1, the calculation is per row, not per country. For example, France has three rows, each with their own total. But step 3 says \"total price for apples in each country\", which would imply summing all rows for the same country. But in Text 1's step 3, they list each row separately for France (Rows 9,14,17) and calculate each row's total, then in step 4, they compare all those individual row totals. That's conflicting. Because if the instruction was to calculate the total per country, they should sum all rows for the same country. But in Text 1, they didn't sum the French rows; they treated each row as a separate entry. So the conclusion in Text 1 is that the highest single transaction (Row 14) is in France. But if the correct approach is to sum all transactions per country, then France's total would be 3830,48, which is higher than any other country's total. However, Text 2 says \"add up the cost of all the apple units purchased from France,\" which would be the sum of all French transactions. So if Text 1's conclusion is based on individual transactions, but Text 2 is based on country totals, then they contradict. Therefore, the answer would be 'no' because the conclusions are based on different aggregations (individual transaction vs. country total). But wait, let me check Text 1's steps again. Step 3 says \"calculate the total price for apples in each country by multiplying the price per unit by the number of units purchased.\" Wait, that's per row, not per country. So maybe the user in Text 1 made a mistake. Because to get the total per country, you should group by country and sum all the (price*units) for that country. But in Text 1, they calculated each row's total and then compared all rows, regardless of country. So for example, France has three rows with totals 523,52; 2204,24; 1102,72. The highest among all rows is 2204,24 (France Row 14). But if you group by country, France's total would be the sum of those three, which is higher than any other country's total. So Text 1's approach is incorrect if the goal is to find the country with the highest total. However, the question is whether the two texts have the same semantic meaning. Text 1 concludes that France (Row 14) has the highest total price. Text 2 says France's total (summing all units) is the highest. These are different conclusions. Therefore, they contradict each other. Hence, the answer is 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno"

The key is to check for contradictions.\n\nText 1 goes through a detailed calculation. It lists rows for different countries where apples (\"Pomme\") were purchased. It calculates the total price for each country. The conclusion is that France (Row 14) has the highest total price of 2204.24.\n\nText 2 starts by saying that Switzerland was incorrectly stated as having the highest total price. It clarifies that France actually has a higher total price when considering unit prices and quantities. The conclusion here is that France's total is higher than Switzerland's.\n\nSo both texts agree that France has a higher total price than Switzerland. Text 1's conclusion is France (specifically Row 14) is highest, while Text 2 corrects a previous claim that Switzerland was highest, affirming France is higher. There's no contradiction here; both agree France is higher. The methods in Text 1 support Text 2's correction. Therefore, the semantic meaning is the same. Answer yes.\n</think>\n\nyes",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring style or details.

The other countries like Suisse (1212.4), Belgique (197.4), and Espagne (1060.46) are lower.\n\nNow, Text 2 says that Spain was incorrectly stated as the highest, but actually France or Switzerland have higher totals. Text 1's result for France is 2204.24, which is higher than Spain's 1060.46. Switzerland's total in Text 1 is 1212.4, which is also higher than Spain's. So Text 2 claims that either France or Switzerland is higher than Spain, which matches Text 1's conclusion that France is the highest. There's no contradiction here. Both agree that Spain isn't the highest, and France is. So the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\nyes",

The conclusion is that France (Row 14) has the highest total price.\n\nText 2 says that someone claimed Belgium has the highest price, but that's incorrect because Belgium isn't listed for apples. It points out a mistake in including Belgium. However, Text 1 actually includes Belgique (Belgium) in Row 8, calculates their total as 197.4, which is much lower than France's 2204.24. \n\nWait, Text 2 says Belgium isn't listed, but Text 1 does list Belgique (Row 8). So Text 2 is correcting a claim that Belgium is the highest by saying Belgium isn't in the data. But Text 1 includes Belgium and shows France is higher. So Text 2 is contradicting Text 1's inclusion of Belgium. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Text 1 includes Belgium as a data point, while Text 2 says Belgium isn't listed. That's conflicting information. So the answer should be 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno"
