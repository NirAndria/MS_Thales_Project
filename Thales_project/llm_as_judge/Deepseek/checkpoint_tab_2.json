They specifically mention that if there's contradictory information or if shared info isn't identical, the answer should be 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, I need to read both texts carefully. \n\nText 1 is about determining significant variables for the dependent variable OPM using a 5% significance level. It lists steps and then goes through each variable's Sig. values. The conclusion is that the significant variables are Constant, SIZE, LIQ, Dg, and Di.\n\nText 2 says that in the regression with OPM as the dependent variable, there are two significant variables, but only Dg is significant at 5%. Wait, that's conflicting. Text 1 lists five variables (including Dg and Di) as significant, but Text 2 says only Dg is significant at 5%. That's a contradiction. \n\nBut wait, maybe Text 2 is saying that there are two variables, but only Dg is at 5%? Let me check again. Text 2 states: \"the model considering OPM as the dependent variable includes two significant variables. However, only the variable Dg is significant at a 5% confidence level.\" So according to Text 2, there are two significant variables, but only Dg meets the 5% threshold. But Text 1 says five variables, including Dg and Di (which has Sig. 0.026, which is less than 0.05). So Di would be significant at 5% as well. \n\nThis is a direct contradiction. Text 1 includes Di as significant, Text 2 says only Dg. Therefore, the shared information about which variables are significant isn't identical. So the answer should be 'no'.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any context. Maybe Text 2 is referring to a different model? Wait, Text 2 mentions that both regressions (ROTA and OPM) have the same explanatory variables, which number 10. But Text 1 lists more variables (like SIZE, LIQ, etc.), but maybe those are part of the 10? The key point is the number of significant variables. Text 1 says five, Text 2 says two with only Dg at 5%. That's conflicting. So the answer is 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",

            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring differences in detail, style, or length. They specifically mention that if there's contradictory information or if shared info isn't identical, the answer should be 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both texts thoroughly. \n\nStarting with Text 1: It's about determining significant variables for the dependent variable OPM using a 5% confidence level. The process involves looking at the Sig. values (p-values) and comparing them to 0.05. The significant variables listed are Constant, SIZE, LIQ, Dg, and Di. The other variables (like TFL, GROW, ATR, etc.) have p-values above 0.05, so they're not significant.\n\nNow, Text 2: It mentions two regressions, one with OPM and another with ROTA as dependent variables. Both use the same 5 explanatory variables. The key points here are that the ROTA model has five significant variables, but none are significant at the 5% level. Wait, that seems contradictory. If none are significant at 5%, how are there five significant variables? Maybe that's a mistake, but I need to check. Alternatively, maybe \"significant\" here refers to a different level, but the text says \"none at 5%\". \n\nWait, the exact wording in Text 2: \"the model considering ROTA as the dependent variable includes five significant variables. However, none of the variables are significant at a 5% confidence level.\" That's conflicting. If none are significant at 5%, then how can there be five significant variables? Unless \"significant\" here is being used in a different context, but that's unclear. Maybe it's a typo or error in the text. But assuming the text is accurate as given, there's a contradiction here. However, the focus is on OPM in Text 1. \n\nWait, Text 2 says \"one of the regressions considers OPM as the dependent variable, while the other considers ROTA\". So, the OPM regression is part of Text 2. But in Text 2, the OPM model's variables aren't discussed in detail. The key point is that for ROTA, there are five variables but none significant at 5%. But for OPM, Text 2 doesn't specify the number of significant variables. Wait, Text 2 says \"both models have the same explanatory variables, which number 5\". Wait, the explanatory variables are 5? But in Text 1, the variables listed are more than 5. Let me check again.\n\nWait, Text 1 lists variables: Constant, SIZE, LIQ, TFL, GROW, ATR, INST, Da, Db, De, Df, Dg, Dh, Di, Dm, Dn. That's a lot more than 5. But Text 2 says both models have the same explanatory variables, which number 5. So there's a contradiction here. Text 1's model for OPM has many variables, but Text 2 says the OPM model has 5 explanatory variables. That's a direct contradiction. Therefore, the information about the number of variables is conflicting. \n\nAdditionally, Text 1 concludes that for OPM, there are five significant variables (including Constant, SIZE, LIQ, Dg, Di). But Text 2 says that the OPM model has five explanatory variables (same as ROTA's model), but for ROTA, none are significant at 5%. However, Text 2 doesn't mention the significance for OPM's model. Wait, let me re-read Text 2.\n\nText 2: \"The table presents the results of two regressions. One of the regressions considers OPM as the dependent variable, while the other considers ROTA as the dependent variable. Both models have the same explanatory variables, which number 5. The model considering ROTA as the dependent variable includes five significant variables. However, none of the variables are significant at a 5% confidence level.\"\n\nWait, that's confusing. The ROTA model has five significant variables, but none are significant at 5%? That doesn't make sense. Unless \"significant\" here is at a different level, but the text says \"none at 5%\". So perhaps there's a mistake in Text 2. Alternatively, maybe the ROTA model has five variables considered, but none meet the 5% threshold. But the way it's phrased is contradictory. However, regardless of that, the main point is comparing Text 1 and Text 2 regarding OPM.\n\nIn Text 1, OPM's model has multiple variables (more than 5) and identifies five as significant. In Text 2, OPM's model is said to have five explanatory variables. So the number of variables in the models is conflicting. Text 1's OPM model has more variables (like SIZE, LIQ, TFL, etc.), while Text 2 says both models (OPM and ROTA) have five variables. This is a contradiction in the number of explanatory variables. Therefore, the shared information (number of variables in OPM's model) is not identical. \n\nAdditionally, Text 1's conclusion is that five variables (including Constant) are significant for OPM. Text 2 doesn't state the significance for OPM's model, only that ROTA's model has five variables but none significant at 5%. But the key contradiction is the number of explanatory variables in the OPM model. Text 1 has more than five, Text 2 says five. Therefore, the answer should be 'no'.\n\nAnother angle: The user says to ignore differences in detail, style, or length. But if the actual information contradicts, like the number of variables, that's a factual discrepancy. So even if the main point about significance is similar, the contradiction in the model setup (number of variables) means the answer is 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",

Both use the same 5 explanatory variables. It says that in the ROTA model, five variables are significant but none at the 5% level. Wait, but Text 1 is about OPM, and Text 2 mentions OPM and ROTA. \n\nSo, Text 1's analysis for OPM found five variables significant at 5% (including Constant, SIZE, LIQ, Dg, Di). Text 2 says that in the ROTA model, five variables are significant but none at 5%. However, Text 2 also mentions that both models share the same set of 5 explanatory variables. Wait, does that mean the OPM model in Text 2 also has five variables? But Text 1's OPM model found five variables significant. However, Text 2 says \"the model with ROTA as the dependent variable, five variables are significant, but none are significant at the 5% confidence level.\" But Text 2 doesn't mention the OPM model's results except that they share the same variables. Wait, Text 2 says \"one regression uses OPM as the dependent variable, while the other uses ROTA. Both models share the same set of 5 explanatory variables.\" Wait, but Text 1's OPM model has more variables listed (like SIZE, LIQ, TFL, etc.), which are more than five. So there's a contradiction here. Text 1's OPM model includes variables like SIZE, LIQ, TFL, GROW, etc., which are more than five. But Text 2 says both models (OPM and ROTA) share the same set of 5 explanatory variables. That's conflicting. Because Text 1's OPM model has more variables. So the number of variables in the models is different. Therefore, the information is contradictory. Hence, the answer should be 'no'.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again. Text 1 lists variables like SIZE, LIQ, TFL, etc., which are more than five. The significant ones are five (including Constant). But Text 2 says both models share the same set of 5 explanatory variables. So if Text 1's model has more variables, that's a contradiction.

If there's any contradictory info or non-identical shared info, answer 'no'; otherwise 'yes'. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both texts thoroughly. \n\nText 1 is about determining significant variables for the dependent variable OPM using a 5% significance level. It lists steps and specific variables (Constant, SIZE, LIQ, Dg, Di) that are significant because their p-values are \u22640.05. The others (like TFL, GROW, etc.) are not significant.\n\nText 2 talks about two regression models: one with OPM and another with ROTA as dependent variables. Both use the same 5 explanatory variables. For ROTA, five variables are significant, but none reach 5% significance. Wait, that seems contradictory. If they're using the same 5 variables for both models, but for ROTA, none are significant at 5%, but for OPM, maybe they are? The text doesn't explicitly state the results for OPM's model except that it's one of the two models. However, Text 1's conclusion is that OPM has five significant variables (including Constant, which is often not counted as an explanatory variable). \n\nWait, Text 2 says \"the other with ROTA. Both models utilize the same 5 explanatory variables.\" So, for OPM, the model uses 5 explanatory variables. But Text 1 lists more variables: SIZE, LIQ, TFL, GROW, ATR, INST, Da, Db, De, Df, Dg, Dh, Di, Dm, Dn. That's way more than 5. So there's a contradiction here. Text 2 says both models use the same 5 variables, but Text 1's analysis includes many more variables. \n\nTherefore, the two texts are contradictory. Text 1's OPM model has multiple variables (including some D variables) that are significant, while Text 2 implies that the OPM model uses only 5 variables, which might be conflicting with the variables listed in Text 1. Also, Text 2 mentions that for ROTA, none of the five variables are significant at 5%, but Text 1's OPM model has five significant variables. However, the key contradiction is the number of variables used in the models. Text 1's model for OPM includes many variables (like 15+), while Text 2 says both models use the same 5 explanatory variables. That's a direct contradiction in the information provided.
