Text 1's Di is significant (0.026 \u22640.05), but Text 2 doesn't mention it. Also, Text 2 says two variables, but Text 1 has five. So the number of significant variables and which ones are included differ. That's a direct contradiction. So the answer should be 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",

            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details, style, or length. The key is to check for contradictions or non-identical shared information.\n\nFirst, Text 1 talks about a regression analysis for OPM as the dependent variable. It lists several variables and their significance levels. The conclusion is that Constant, SIZE, LIQ, Dg, and Di are significant at the 5% level. So, five variables are significant here.\n\nText 2 mentions two regressions: one with OPM and another with ROTA as dependent variables. Both have the same explanatory variables, totaling five. However, it states that for the ROTA model, five variables are significant, but none are significant at the 5% level. Wait, that's confusing. If none are significant at 5%, how are there five significant variables? Maybe a typo? Or perhaps it's saying that for ROTA, five variables are considered, but none meet the 5% threshold. But the key point here is about OPM. Text 2 says that one regression uses OPM, but it doesn't explicitly state the number of significant variables for OPM. It only mentions that the ROTA model has five variables, none significant. \n\nWait, Text 2 says \"Both models have the same explanatory variables, which number 5.\" So each model (OPM and ROTA) has five explanatory variables. Then, for the ROTA model, five variables are significant, but none at 5%? That seems contradictory. Maybe it's a mistake. But focusing on OPM: Text 1 says five variables are significant (Constant, SIZE, LIQ, Dg, Di). Text 2 says the OPM model has five explanatory variables but doesn't state how many are significant. Wait, Text 2 says \"the model considering ROTA as the dependent variable includes five significant variables. However, none of the variables are significant at a 5 confidence level.\" So for ROTA, five variables are significant but not at 5%? That doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a typo, like \"5% confidence level\" but the variables are significant at a lower level. But the main point is about OPM. Text 2 doesn't mention the significance of variables for OPM, only that there's a model with OPM as dependent variable and five explanatory variables. Text 1, however, lists five significant variables for OPM. But Text 2 doesn't say anything about the significance of OPM's variables. So there's no direct contradiction here. However, Text 2 says that the ROTA model has five variables, none significant at 5%, which is a separate point. Since the question is whether the two texts have the same semantic meaning, but Text 1 is about OPM's significant variables, and Text 2 mentions OPM's model but doesn't state its significance, while discussing ROTA's model. So the information about OPM in Text 2 is incomplete. But the user said to ignore differences in detail or partial information. However, if Text 2 doesn't mention the significance for OPM, but Text 1 does, then they might not be contradictory. Wait, but Text 2 says \"Both models have the same explanatory variables, which number 5.\" So OPM's model has five variables. Text 1 lists more variables (like SIZE, LIQ, TFL, etc.), which are more than five. Wait, in Text 1, the variables listed are Constant, SIZE, LIQ, TFL, GROW, ATR, INST, Da, Db, De, Df, Dg, Dh, Di, Dm, Dn. That's way more than five. But Text 2 says both models have five explanatory variables. So here's a contradiction. Text 1 has many variables, but Text 2 says the OPM model has five. Therefore, the number of explanatory variables is conflicting. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, the answer should be 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",

So five variables are significant here.\n\nText 2 says that for OPM, the model uses the same 5 explanatory variables as another model (ROTA). But in the ROTA model, five variables are significant, none at 5%. Wait, but Text 1's OPM model has five variables significant at 5%. However, Text 2 mentions that for OPM, the model shares the same 5 variables. Wait, Text 2 says \"Both models share the same set of 5 explanatory variables.\" So OPM and ROTA models each have 5 variables. But in Text 1, OPM's model includes more variables: Constant, SIZE, LIQ, Dg, Di (that's five, but also others like TFL, GROW, etc. which are not significant). Wait, maybe Text 1 is considering all variables, but Text 2 says the models each have 5 variables. Wait, Text 1 lists variables like SIZE, LIQ, TFL, etc., but the significant ones are five. However, Text 2 states that both models (OPM and ROTA) share the same set of 5 explanatory variables. So if Text 1's OPM model has more than 5 variables, that's a contradiction. Wait, in Text 1, the variables listed are Constant, SIZE, LIQ, TFL, GROW, ATR, INST, Da, Db, De, Df, Dg, Dh, Di, Dm, Dn. That's a lot more than 5. But Text 2 says both models use the same 5 variables. So Text 1's OPM model has more variables than Text 2's OPM model. That's a contradiction. Therefore, the answer is no.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the two texts have the same semantic meaning, ignoring style or length. If there's a contradiction or non-identical info, answer 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'. \n\nFirst, Text 1 is about determining significant variables for OPM at a 5% confidence level. It lists steps and specific variables (Constant, SIZE, LIQ, Dg, Di) as significant. All these have Sig. \u22640.05.\n\nText 2 mentions two regression models: one for OPM and another for ROTA. It states that for ROTA, five variables are significant, but none reach 5% significance. However, for OPM, it says both models use the same 5 variables, but the key point here is that Text 2 says \"the other with ROTA. Both models utilize the same 5 explanatory variables. For the regression with ROTA as the dependent variable, five variables are identified as significant. Among them, none reach significance at the 5 confidence level.\"\n\nWait, Text 1 says for OPM, the significant variables are 5 (including Constant, SIZE, LIQ, Dg, Di). Text 2 says that for ROTA, five variables are significant but none at 5%. But Text 2's first part says both models use the same 5 variables. Wait, no\u2014Text 2 says \"the same 5 explanatory variables\" for both models. So, the OPM model uses 5 variables, and the ROTA model uses the same 5. But in Text 1, the OPM model has more variables (like SIZE, LIQ, etc., and several D variables). So there's a contradiction here. Text 1 lists more variables (like Constant, SIZE, LIQ, Dg, Di, etc.) as part of the analysis, but Text 2 says both models use the same 5 variables. That's conflicting. Also, Text 1's OPM model found 5 variables significant at 5%, but Text 2 says for ROTA, five variables are significant but none at 5%. However, Text 2's statement about OPM isn't clear. Wait, Text 2 says \"the other with ROTA. Both models utilize the same 5 explanatory variables. For the regression with ROTA as the dependent variable, five variables are identified as significant. Among them, none reach significance at the 5 confidence level.\" So, the OPM model in Text 2 uses 5 variables, same as ROTA. But in Text 1, the OPM model has more variables (like SIZE, LIQ, Dg, Di, etc.), which are more than 5. So the number of variables considered is different. Text 1's OPM model includes variables like SIZE, LIQ, TFL, GROW, ATR, INST, and several D variables. But Text 2 says both models use the same 5 variables. That's a contradiction. Therefore, the answer should be 'no' because the variables considered in the models are different, leading to conflicting information.\n</think>\n\nno"
