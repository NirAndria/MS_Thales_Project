            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the two texts have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details like style or length. But if there's contradictory info or any shared info isn't identical, I should say no. Otherwise, yes.\n\nFirst, I'll read both texts carefully. \n\nText 1 describes an oscilloscope trace. It starts stable near 0 volts, has minor oscillations for the first 25 time units. Then at 50 units, a sharp spike to 1.5 volts, followed by a drop to -1 volt. Then recovery to 0 and remains stable from 75 to 175 units. It mentions a transient event like a noise spike.\n\nText 2 is a graph with time in milliseconds and voltage. Voltage stays at 0 until 52 ms, then rises to 1.75 volts at 62 ms. Drops to -0.9 volts at 70 ms, then gradually back to 0 and stays there.\n\nNow, check for contradictions. \n\nIn Text 1, the spike is at 50 units (time not specified as ms) to 1.5V. Text 2 says 52 ms to 1.75V. The voltage values here are different: 1.5 vs 1.75. Also, the drop in Text 1 is to -1V, while Text 2 says -0.9V. These are close but not identical. \n\nTiming: Text 1 mentions the spike around 50 units, then drop, recovery by 75 units. Text 2's spike starts at 52ms, peaks at 62ms, drops to -0.9 at 70ms, then back to 0. The time units in Text 1 aren't specified as milliseconds, but assuming they are similar (since both are time units), the exact timings differ. \n\nAlso, Text 1 mentions minor oscillations before the spike, but Text 2 says voltage remains at 0 until 52ms. That's a contradiction. Text 1 has oscillations in the first 25 units, while Text 2 has no movement until 52ms. \n\nSo, the key points: voltage values differ (1.5 vs 1.75, -1 vs -0.9), timing of events (25 units vs 52ms start), and presence of initial oscillations vs stable 0V. These are contradictions in the shared information. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the two texts have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details like style or length. They specifically mention that if there's contradictory info or non-identical shared info, the answer should be 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, I need to parse both texts carefully.\n\nText 1 describes an oscilloscope trace. It starts stable near 0 volts, has minor oscillations for the first 25 time units. Then at 50 units, a sharp spike to 1.5V, followed by a drop to -1V. Then recovery to 0V and remains stable from 75 to 175 units. It mentions a transient event like a noise spike.\n\nText 2 is a graph with time in milliseconds and voltage in volts. Starts at 0V until 52ms, then rises to peak at 1.75V at 62ms. Drops to -0.9V at 70ms, then back to 0V and stabilizes.\n\nNow, comparing key points. Both describe a voltage starting at 0, a spike, a drop below zero, then recovery. But the specifics differ. \n\nTime units: Text 1 uses \"units of time\" (maybe arbitrary), Text 2 uses milliseconds. But the user says to ignore differences in detail, so units might not matter. However, the actual timing and voltage values differ. \n\nIn Text 1, the spike is at 50 units to 1.5V, drop to -1V. In Text 2, spike starts at 52ms, peaks at 62ms (so 10ms duration?), 1.75V, then drops to -0.9V at 70ms. The voltage values are different (1.5 vs 1.75, -1 vs -0.9). Also, the time frames: Text 1's spike is around 50 units, then recovery by 75. Text 2's events happen between 52ms to 70ms, then stabilizes. \n\nThe user says to ignore differences in detail, but if the shared info isn't identical, answer 'no'. The key events are similar: spike, drop, recovery. But the exact voltages and timing are different. Are these considered contradictory? The question says if any shared info is not identical, answer 'no'. So even if the general shape is the same, the specific numbers differ. For example, 1.5V vs 1.75V and -1V vs -0.9V. These are not identical. Therefore, the answer should be 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. I need to figure out if the two texts have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details like style or length. The key is to check if there's any contradictory information or if shared info isn't identical.\n\nFirst, I'll go through Text 1. It describes an oscilloscope trace. The main points are:\n- Starts stable near 0V.\n- Minor oscillations for first 25 time units.\n- Sharp spike to ~1.5V around 50 units.\n- Sudden drop to -1V.\n- Quick recovery to 0V.\n- Remains stable from 75 to 175 units.\n\nText 2 is about a graph with time in milliseconds and voltage. The points here:\n- Voltage constant at 0V up to 52ms.\n- Rises to 1.75V at 62ms.\n- Drops to -0.9V at 70ms.\n- Gradually returns to 0V and stays.\n\nComparing the key events: both start at 0V, have a spike, a drop below zero, then return to 0. But the numbers differ. Text 1 mentions 1.5V peak at 50 units, Text 2 says 1.75V at 62ms. The drop in Text 1 is -1V, Text 2 is -0.9V. Time units in Text 1 are generic (units), Text 2 uses milliseconds with specific timings (52ms, 62ms, etc.). Also, Text 1's recovery is quick, while Text 2's is gradual. Post-recovery, Text 1 mentions stability from 75 units onward, Text 2 just says returns to 0 and stays. \n\nContradictions in voltage values (1.5 vs 1.75, -1 vs -0.9) and timing (50 units vs 52ms and 62ms). Also, the recovery phase is described differently (quick vs gradual). Since the question says to ignore differences in detail or style, but if any shared info isn't identical, answer no. The numerical values and some event descriptions differ, which are factual contradictions. So the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno"

But if there's contradictory info or any shared info isn't identical, I should say no.\n\nFirst, I'll read both texts carefully. \n\nText 1 describes an oscilloscope trace of voltage over time. It starts stable near 0V, has minor oscillations for the first 25 time units. Then a sharp spike to 1.5V at 50 units, drops to -1V, recovers to 0V, and stays stable from 75 to 175 units. It mentions a transient event like a noise spike.\n\nText 2 talks about a graph with temperature on the horizontal axis and current on the vertical. Wait, that's different from Text 1, which is voltage over time. Text 2 says voltage fluctuates randomly, peaks at 10V at 30ms, drops to 5V at 50ms, then increases to 8V at 100ms, and keeps rising without reaching 0V. \n\nSo right away, the axes are different. Text 1 is voltage vs. time, Text 2 is temperature vs. current but mentions voltage. That's conflicting. Also, the values and events don't match. Text 1 has a spike to 1.5V, then drop to -1V, recovery. Text 2's voltage peaks at 10V, drops to 5V, then goes up to 8V and keeps rising. The directions and values are different. Plus, Text 1 ends at 0V, Text 2 never reaches 0V. Contradictory info. So the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",

The key points:\n- Current fluctuates between 0-5A until 52s.\n- Decreases slowly to 0.5A at 62s.\n- Rises sharply to 2A at 70s, then gradually decreases back to 5A.\n- Remains unstable at 5A.\n\nNow, compare the two. Text 1 is voltage, Text 2 is current. Different units (volts vs amperes). The events described are different: Text 1 has a spike and drop, then stabilizes. Text 2 has fluctuations, a slow decrease, a sharp rise, then back to 5A with instability. The time scales are different (units vs seconds, but maybe that's a detail). The main contradiction is the behavior after the spike/drop. Text 1 stabilizes, Text 2 goes back to 5A and remains unstable. Also, the values (1.5V vs 5A) are different. Since they're different quantities (voltage vs current) and the events don't match, even if the structure of a spike is there, the details contradict. So the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",

The current is erratic until 52s, then decreases slowly to -1.75mA at 62s. Then rises to 0.9mA at 70s, sharply increases to 5mA, and continues rising unpredictably.\n\nNow, compare the key points. Both texts describe a signal over time, but the first is voltage (volts) and the second is current (milliamperes). Different units, so that's a difference. \n\nIn Text 1, the spike is around 50 units (time) to 1.5V, then drop to -1V, recovery, and stability. Text 2: erratic until 52s, then slow decrease to -1.75mA at 62s, then rise to 0.9mA at 70s, then sharp increase to 5mA. \n\nThe events in Text 2 don't match Text 1. Text 1 has a sharp spike followed by a sudden drop and quick recovery. Text 2 has a slow decrease after 52s, reaching a lower value (-1.75 vs -1), then a rise to 0.9, then a sharp increase to 5. The timing and the nature of the changes (sharp spike vs slow decrease followed by a rise and another spike) are different. Also, the final state in Text 1 is stability, while Text 2 ends with the current rising unpredictably. \n\nContradictory information: the behavior after the initial spike/drop. Text 1 stabilizes, Text 2 has another spike. Also, the units (voltage vs current) are different, but the question says to ignore differences in detail. However, the actual events described are conflicting. So even if the units are different, the events' structure and outcomes are contradictory. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno"
