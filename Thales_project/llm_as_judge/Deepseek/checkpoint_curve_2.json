The curve starts stable near 0V, has minor oscillations for the first 25 time units. Then a sharp spike to ~1.5V around 50 units, followed by a drop to -1V.

Both mention starting at 0V, a sharp spike upwards. However, Text 1's spike is around 50 units (maybe ms?) to 1.5V, then drops to -1V. Text 2's spike is at 52ms to 1.75V, then drops to 0.9V. The recovery in Text 1 is a sudden drop to -1V and then stabilizes. Text 2's drop is to 0.9V, then gradual increase back to 0. \n\nThe voltage values after the spike are conflicting: Text 1 goes negative (-1V), Text 2 stays positive (0.9V). Also, the recovery phases differ: Text 1 stabilizes quickly after the drop, while Text 2 has a gradual increase back to 0. \n\nThese differences in voltage values and the direction of the drop (negative vs. positive) are contradictions. Even if we ignore exact numbers, the direction (negative vs. positive) is a key contradiction. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",

            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring style and length but checking for contradictions or major discrepancies.\n\nFirst, Text 1 describes an oscilloscope trace with voltage over time. It starts stable at 0V, has minor oscillations for the first 25 time units, a sharp spike to 1.5V at 50 units, then a drop to -1V, recovery to 0V, and remains stable. The events are transient with a quick recovery.\n\nText 2 talks about a graph with temperature on the horizontal and current on vertical axes, but mentions voltage. Wait, that's conflicting. The axes are different. Text 1's axes are voltage vs. time, while Text 2's are temperature vs. current. But the description in Text 2 is about voltage, which doesn't align with the axes. That's a contradiction in what the axes represent.\n\nLooking at the voltage details: Text 2 says voltage peaks at 10V at 30ms, drops to 5V at 50ms, then increases to 8V at 100ms, and continues rising without reaching 0V. Text 1's voltage goes up to 1.5V, drops to -1V, then recovers to 0V and stays there. The values here are way different (1.5V vs. 10V, -1V vs. 5V drop). Also, Text 1 ends at 0V, while Text 2 never reaches 0V. The direction of the voltage changes after the spike is opposite: Text 1 drops below zero and recovers, Text 2 drops to 5V then rises again. The final states are conflicting (stable at 0V vs. rising never reaching 0V). \n\nAdditionally, the time units in Text 1 are in \"units\" (maybe arbitrary), while Text 2 uses milliseconds. But even if we ignore units, the events' timing and voltage levels are too different. The presence of contradictory information in axes labels and voltage behavior means they don't have the same semantic meaning. So the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring differences in detail, style, or length. If there's contradictory information or any shared info isn't identical, I should answer 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'. Values can be rounded, and info can be partial in one text. Only answer 'no' if there's a contradiction or dates/values are too far apart.\n\nFirst, let's break down Text 1. It describes an oscilloscope trace (voltage over time). The key points are:\n1. Starts stable near 0V.\n2. Minor oscillations around 0V for first 25 time units.\n3. Sharp spike to ~1.5V at 50 units.\n4. Sudden drop to -1V.\n5. Recovery to 0V.\n6. Remains stable from 75-175 units with minor fluctuations.\nMentions it's a transient event like a noise spike, then recovery.\n\nText 2 is a graph with time (seconds) on horizontal and current (amperes) on vertical. Key points:\n- Current fluctuates between 0-5A until 52s.\n- Decreases slowly to 0.5A at 62s.\n- Rises sharply to 2A at 70s.\n- Gradually decreases back to 5A, remains unstable.\n\nComparing the two. Text 1 is voltage, Text 2 is current. Different units (volts vs. amperes). That's a difference in what's being measured. But maybe the question is about the shape of the curve, not the units? Wait, the user says to ignore differences in detail, style, or length. But if the actual data (like units) are different, does that matter? The problem states that if there's contradictory information, answer 'no'. So if one is voltage and the other current, but the events described are similar, but the units are different, is that a contradiction? Hmm. The user says to answer 'no' if there's a contradiction. But maybe the units are part of the detail to ignore. Wait, the instruction says to ignore differences in detail, style, or length. So maybe the fact that one is voltage and the other current is a detail difference. But wait, voltage and current are different physical quantities. If the texts are describing different measurements (voltage vs. current), but the events (spikes, drops) are similar, does that count as same semantic meaning? Or is that a contradiction because they refer to different quantities?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the main events are contradictory. Let's look at the events:\n\nText 1: Starts stable near 0V, minor oscillations for first 25 units. Then at 50 units, sharp spike to 1.5V, then sudden drop to -1V, then recovery to 0V, remains stable from 75-175.\n\nText 2: Fluctuates between 0-5A until 52s. Then decreases to 0.5A at 62s. Then rises to 2A at 70s, then decreases back to 5A and remains unstable.\n\nSo the time scales are different. Text 1's events happen at 25, 50, 75 units. Text 2's events at 52, 62, 70 seconds. But the user says to ignore differences in detail, so maybe the time units being different (units vs. seconds) is okay. But the actual values: in Text 1, after the spike and drop, it stabilizes. In Text 2, after the rise to 2A, it goes back to 5A and remains unstable. So in Text 1, after the spike and drop, it's stable. In Text 2, after the spike (rise to 2A), it goes back to 5A and is unstable. That seems contradictory. Text 1 ends with stability, Text 2 ends with instability. Also, the direction of the spikes: Text 1 has a spike up to 1.5V then drop to -1V. Text 2 has a spike up to 2A, then back to 5A. Wait, in Text 2, after 70s, it decreases back to 5A. Wait, the initial fluctuation is between 0-5A. Then after 52s, it decreases to 0.5A at 62s, then rises to 2A at 70s, then decreases back to 5A. So the final state is back to 5A but unstable. Whereas Text 1 ends near 0V with minor fluctuations. So the final states are different. Also, the initial part: Text 1 has minor oscillations around 0V for first 25 units. Text 2 has fluctuations between 0-5A until 52s. That's a big difference. The initial behavior is different: one is near 0 with minor oscillations, the other is fluctuating between 0 and 5. Then, the spike in Text 1 is up to 1.5V, then drop to -1V. Text 2's spike is up to 2A, but after a decrease to 0.5A. The recovery in Text 1 is to 0V, stable. Text 2's recovery is back to 5A but unstable. So the overall trends and values are different. The directions of the spikes and the final states are contradictory. Therefore, the answer should be 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details, style, or length. If there's a contradiction or non-identical info, answer 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'. \n\nFirst, Text 1 describes an oscilloscope trace with voltage over time. It starts stable at 0V, minor oscillations for first 25 units. Then a sharp spike to 1.5V at 50 units, sudden drop to -1V, recovery to 0V, and remains stable from 75 to 175 units. It mentions a transient event like a noise spike.\n\nText 2 is a graph with time in seconds (x-axis) and current in milliamperes (y-axis). Current fluctuates erratically until 52s. Then decreases slowly to 1.75mA at 62s. Rises to 0.9mA at 70s, then sharply increases to 5mA and continues rising unpredictably.\n\nComparing the two: \n\n- Text 1 is voltage, Text 2 is current. Different units (volts vs milliamperes). But maybe that's a detail? The question says to ignore differences in detail. However, if the quantities are different but the events are similar, maybe it's okay. But wait, the actual events described are different. \n\nIn Text 1, after the spike at 50 units, there's a sudden drop to -1V, then recovery to 0V and stability. Text 2: after 52s, current decreases slowly to 1.75mA at 62s, then rises to 0.9mA at 70s, then sharp increase to 5mA. \n\nSo the events' shapes are different. Text 1 has a spike followed by a drop and stabilization. Text 2 has erratic until 52s, then slow decrease, then rise, then sharp increase. The key events don't match. Also, Text 1's spike is at 50 units (time?), reaches 1.5V, then drops to -1V. Text 2's lowest point is 1.75mA (which is a positive value) at 62s, then rises to 0.9mA (which is lower than 1.75mA?), then sharp increase. Wait, that seems contradictory. If it decreases to 1.75mA, then rises to 0.9mA, that would mean going down from 1.75 to 0.9, but \"rises\" would imply increasing. Maybe a typo? Or maybe the values are going from higher to lower. But regardless, the events' timing and direction are different. \n\nAlso, Text 1's event is a spike and quick recovery, while Text 2's has a slow decrease followed by a rise and then a sharp increase. The overall behavior is different. Moreover, Text 1 ends with stability, while Text 2 ends with rising unpredictably. These are contradictory in the post-event behavior. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'no' because the events described are contradictory in their progression and outcomes.\n</think>\n\nno"
