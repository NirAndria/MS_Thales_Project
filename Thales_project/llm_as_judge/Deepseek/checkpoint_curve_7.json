            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring differences in detail, style, or length. They also mention that if there's contradictory information or any shared info isn't identical, the answer should be 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, I need to read both texts carefully. \n\nText 1 is a detailed analysis. It breaks down the ozone loss percentages in both regions from 1988 to 2020. It starts by identifying data points (red squares for Antarctic, blue circles for Arctic). Then it gives initial observations about the ranges: Antarctic 40-60%, Arctic 5-35%. Then it goes into trends over time for each region. For the Antarctic, it mentions an increase from 1988-1995 to around 55%, fluctuations but remaining high until 2000, variability between 45-55% from 2000-2010, and a slight upward trend peaking at 55% in 2020. For the Arctic, it's an increase to 25% by 1995, significant fluctuations between 10-30% until 2000, variability from 5-30% from 2000-2010, and a slight upward trend to 35% by 2020. The comparison notes Antarctic is consistently higher, Arctic more variable, both have upward trends. The conclusion restates that Antarctic is more severe, Arctic has lower percentages but more variability.\n\nText 2 is a shorter summary. It says the graph contrasts the two regions from 1988-2020. Antarctic (red squares) has higher ozone loss (40-55%) with stable values and minor fluctuations. Arctic (blue circles) has more variability, fluctuating between 5-35%. The conclusion is that Antarctic is stable and severe, Arctic has erratic changes.\n\nNow, check for contradictions. Both texts agree on the regions, the time frame, the symbols (red squares vs blue circles), the ranges (Antarctic 40-60% vs 40-55% in Text 2; Arctic 5-35% in both). Text 1 mentions a peak at 60% for Antarctic, but Text 2 says up to 55%. Wait, Text 1 says \"range from approximately 40% to 60%\" in initial observations, but in the conclusion, it says \"ranging from 40% to 60%\". However, in the trends, after 2010, Antarctic peaks at 55% in 2020. Text 2 says Antarctic ranges between 40-55%. So there's a discrepancy here. Text 1 mentions 60% as part of the range, but Text 2 caps it at 55%. That's a contradiction because 60% vs 55% is a difference in data. Also, Text 1 says Arctic peaks at 35% in 2020, which Text 2 doesn't mention, but Text 2's upper limit is 35% for Arctic, which matches. However, the Antarctic upper limit in Text 1 is 60%, but Text 2 says 55%. That's conflicting information. \n\nAdditionally, Text 1 mentions an upward trend in both regions towards 2020. Text 2 doesn't mention the upward trend but focuses on the variability. However, the user says to ignore differences in detail or length. The key is whether the shared information is identical. The problem here is the maximum ozone loss in Antarctic: 60% vs 55%. If Text 1 states that the range is up to 60%, but Text 2 says up to 55%, that's a contradiction. Even if Text 1's trend shows a peak at 55% in 2020, the initial range includes 60%, which Text 2 doesn't. So the shared information about the maximum in Antarctic isn't identical. Therefore, they contradict each other. Hence, the answer should be 'no'.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check again. Text 1's initial observation says Antarctic ranges from 40% to 60%, but in the trends, after 2010, it peaks at 55% in 2020. So maybe the 60% was an earlier peak? Let me look. In Text 1's trends for Antarctic: from 1988-1995, it reaches around 55%. Then from 1995-2000, remains around 50%. 2000-2010 between 45-55%. After 2010, peaks at 55% in 2020. So where does the 60% come from? The initial observation says 40-60%, but the trend details don't mention 60%. That's conflicting within Text 1 itself. Maybe a typo? Or perhaps the initial observation is a general range, but the actual data points never reach 60%. If Text 1's initial observation says 40-60%, but the detailed trends only go up to 55%, that's an inconsistency. However, Text 2 says Antarctic ranges between 40-55%. So if Text 1's initial statement is incorrect, but the actual data peaks at 55%, then Text 2 is accurate. But the user is to take the texts as given. So if Text 1 says 40-60% and Text 2 says 40-55%, that's a contradiction. Therefore, the answer is 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring differences in detail, style, or length. If there's any contradictory info or non-identical shared info, the answer is 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, I'll read both texts carefully.\n\nText 1 is a detailed analysis comparing Antarctic and Arctic ozone loss from 1988-2020. It breaks down the data points, trends, and concludes that Antarctic has higher, more consistent loss with some variability, while Arctic is more variable but lower overall. Both show a slight upward trend towards 2020.\n\nText 2 also compares the two regions over three decades. It states Antarctic ozone loss is high and steady around 50%, with slight variations. The Arctic has dynamic patterns with peaks in specific years (1996, 2004, 2012, 2020), suggesting more fluctuations due to atmospheric conditions. It mentions the Antarctic's stability due to the ozone hole.\n\nNow, check for contradictions or non-identical shared info. Both agree Antarctic has higher, more stable loss; Arctic more variable. Both mention upward trend in Text 1, but Text 2 doesn't explicitly state an upward trend, just peaks in certain years. However, Text 1's upward trend in Arctic peaks at 35% in 2020, which might align with Text 2's 2020 peak. But Text 2's peaks are in specific years, which Text 1 doesn't mention. Text 1 talks about ranges (Antarctic 40-60%, Arctic 5-35%) while Text 2 says Antarctic around 50%. Also, Text 1's conclusion mentions both regions have slight upward trends, but Text 2 doesn't mention trends, just peaks. \n\nContradictions? Not exactly, but Text 2's focus on specific peaks and reasons (atmospheric conditions) isn't in Text 1. However, the main points about higher Antarctic loss and Arctic variability are the same. But the user said to ignore differences in detail or style. However, if shared info isn't identical, answer 'no'. The key is whether the shared information is identical. For example, Text 1 says Antarctic ranges 40-60%, Text 2 says around 50% with slight variations. Are these compatible? Yes, because 50% is within 40-60%, and slight variations could mean the range. But Text 1's Arctic ranges 5-35%, while Text 2's Arctic peaks at certain years (like 2020 at 35% in Text 1, which matches Text 2's 2020 peak). However, Text 2 doesn't mention the upward trend in both regions. Wait, Text 1 says both have slight upward trends towards 2020. Text 2 says Arctic has peaks in 1996, 2004, 2012, 2020. If the upward trend is a key point in Text 1, but Text 2 doesn't mention it, that's a difference. So, if Text 1 states both regions have upward trends, but Text 2 doesn't mention that, then the shared info isn't identical. Therefore, the answer would be 'no' because the upward trend is a shared point in Text 1 but absent in Text 2. Alternatively, maybe the peaks in Text 2 imply an upward trend? Not necessarily. Peaks could be sporadic. So, the presence of an upward trend in Text 1 vs. peaks in Text 2 might be contradictory or non-identical. Therefore, the answer is 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",

If there's any contradictory info or if shared info isn't identical, answer 'no'; otherwise, 'yes'. \n\nFirst, I'll read both texts carefully. \n\nText 1 is a detailed analysis of ozone loss percentages in Antarctic and Arctic regions from 1988 to 2020. It breaks down the data points, trends over time, and a comparison. Key points: Antarctic has higher loss (40-60%) vs Arctic (5-35%), both show variability (Arctic more so), and both have a slight upward trend towards 2020.\n\nText 2 is a summary that also compares the two regions. It mentions Antarctic's persistently high levels (ozone hole) and Arctic's lower but episodic sharp increases. It talks about different environmental challenges and tailored approaches.\n\nNow, check for contradictions. Both agree Antarctic has higher ozone loss. Text 1 says Arctic has more variability, Text 2 mentions \"sharp increases at irregular intervals\" which aligns with variability. Both note upward trends in Text 1 (slight upward trend to 2020) vs Text 2's \"episodic events leading to temporary but substantial depletion\". Wait, Text 1's Arctic trend is a slight upward trend, while Text 2's Arctic has sharp increases episodically. Are these the same? Text 1's data shows Arctic ozone loss increasing from 5% to 35% over time with fluctuations, peaking at 35% in 2020. Text 2's episodic events might refer to those fluctuations but also mentions temporary depletion. However, Text 1's conclusion is an overall slight upward trend. So, does Text 2's description of episodic events contradict the upward trend? Maybe. If Text 2 says the Arctic has temporary spikes but overall, is there a trend? Text 1 says there's a slight upward trend. If Text 2 doesn't mention the upward trend but focuses on episodic events, that could be a contradiction. Because Text 1's conclusion includes both variability and an upward trend, while Text 2 emphasizes episodic events leading to temporary depletion. The upward trend in Text 1 suggests that despite fluctuations, the overall direction is upwards. Text 2's \"temporary but substantial depletion\" might not capture the upward trend, implying that after spikes, it goes back down. But according to Text 1, after 2010, Arctic peaks at 35% in 2020, which is higher than previous peaks. So if Text 2 doesn't mention the upward trend, that's a missing element. But the question says to ignore differences in detail. However, if the shared information is contradictory, then 'no'. \n\nAnother point: Text 1 says both regions have a slight upward trend towards 2020. Text 2 doesn't mention the upward trend for either region. But does that make them contradictory? If Text 2 says the Arctic's depletion is temporary (i.e., not a sustained trend), but Text 1 says there's an upward trend, that's a contradiction. So, if Text 2's \"temporary\" implies that after each spike, it goes back down, but Text 1's data shows that the peaks are getting higher over time (from 25% in 1995 to 35% in 2020), then Text 2's description might not align with the upward trend. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. \n\nSo, the answer would be 'no' because Text 1 mentions an upward trend in both regions, while Text 2's focus on temporary spikes in the Arctic might not account for the overall upward trend, leading to contradictory information.\n</think>\n\nno"

So, ozone loss is increasing in both, but Antarctic is worse.\n\nText 2 says that ozone loss in both regions has been steadily decreasing since 1988, with no significant differences. They have identical patterns and percentages, indicating uniform global recovery.\n\nWait, that's a contradiction. Text 1 says both regions have an upward trend (increasing ozone loss) towards 2020, while Text 2 claims they're steadily decreasing (recovery). Also, Text 1 points out Antarctic is much worse, but Text 2 says no significant differences. The shared information about trends and regional differences is contradictory.

Both show a slight upward trend towards 2020.\n\nText 2 says there's no discernible pattern or trend in ozone loss for either region. It claims percentages fluctuate randomly with no consistent differences, suggesting unpredictability without geographic/climatic patterns.\n\nNow, comparing the two. Text 1 clearly states specific trends: Antarctic higher than Arctic, upward trends, more variability in Arctic. Text 2 contradicts this by saying no trends, random fluctuations, no consistent differences. \n\nSo, the key points are opposite. Text 1 says there are identifiable trends and differences between regions, while Text 2 denies any patterns or consistent differences. That's a direct contradiction.

It claims that the Arctic has higher and more stable ozone loss, while Antarctic has lower and more variable percentages. It suggests the Arctic is more severely affected, which contradicts Text 1.\n\nSo, the main contradiction is which region has higher ozone loss. Text 1 says Antarctic is higher, Text 2 says Arctic. That's a direct contradiction. Therefore, the answer should be 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno"
