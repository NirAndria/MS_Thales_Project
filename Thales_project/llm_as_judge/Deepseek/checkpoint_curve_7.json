            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring differences in detail, style, or length. If there's any contradiction or non-identical shared info, answer 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'. Values can be rounded, partial info is okay. Only answer 'no' if there's a contradiction or dates/values are too far apart.\n\nFirst, both texts are comparing ozone loss percentages between Antarctic and Arctic from 1988 to 2020. Text 1 is more detailed, breaking down trends over different periods, while Text 2 is a summary. \n\nLooking at the key points:\n\n- Both mention Antarctic (red squares) has higher ozone loss than Arctic (blue circles).\n- Text 1 says Antarctic ranges 40-60%, Arctic 5-35%. Text 2 says Antarctic 40-55, Arctic 5-35. The upper end for Antarctic in Text 1 is 60%, Text 2 says 55. But the user allows rounding and partial info. 55 vs 60 might be a difference. However, in Text 1's conclusion, it says \"ranging from 40% to 60%\" in the summary, but in the detailed analysis, the peak in 2020 is 55%. Maybe the 60% is a peak at some point? But Text 2 says \"typically ranging between 40 and 55\". So there's a discrepancy here. If Text 1 mentions up to 60% and Text 2 caps at 55, that's a difference. But the user says if values are too far, answer no. Is 55 vs 60 too far? Maybe, but maybe they rounded. Let's check other points.\n\nText 1 mentions both regions have a slight upward trend towards 2020. Text 2 doesn't mention trends over time, just the variability. So Text 2 doesn't contradict the trend but doesn't mention it. Since the user says to ignore differences in detail or length, maybe that's okay. But if the trend is a key point, and Text 2 omits it, does that count as a contradiction? The user says if any shared info is not identical, answer no. Wait, the instruction says: \"If they contain contradictory information or any shared information is not identical, answer 'no'.\" So if both mention something and it's not identical, then no. But if one has extra info that the other doesn't, but the shared parts are the same, then yes. \n\nText 1's conclusion says both regions show a slight upward trend towards 2020. Text 2 doesn't mention trends. Since Text 2 doesn't talk about trends, there's no contradiction. The shared information is about the ranges and variability. \n\nAnother point: Text 1 says Antarctic ozone loss peaks around 2020 at approximately 55%, but in the initial observations, it's 40-60%. Text 2 says Antarctic ranges 40-55. So maybe Text 2 is rounding or taking a typical range, while Text 1 mentions a peak up to 60%. But the user says values can be rounded. If 55 is close to 60, but the user says \"if dates/values are too far from each other\" answer no. 55 vs 60 is a 5% difference. Is that too far? The user didn't specify a threshold. Maybe in context, 5% is significant, but ozone loss percentages are often discussed in tens, so 5% might be considered a notable difference. However, the user allows rounding. If Text 1's peak is 55% in 2020, but the initial range says up to 60%, maybe that's a peak in a different year. But Text 2 says \"typically ranging between 40 and 55\", which might exclude the 60% peak. So there's a contradiction here. If Text 1 says up to 60% and Text 2 says up to 55%, that's conflicting information. Therefore, the answer would be 'no' because the ranges aren't identical and the peak values differ beyond rounding.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring style or length. I need to focus on contradictions or major discrepancies.\n\nFirst, Text 1 gives a detailed analysis. It mentions Antarctic ozone loss ranging from 40-60%, with trends from 1988 to 2020. It notes an increase up to 1995, fluctuations until 2000, variability until 2010, and a slight upward trend peaking at 55% by 2020. For the Arctic, it's 5-35%, with similar time periods, more variability, and peaks at 35% in 2020. Both regions have an upward trend towards 2020.\n\nText 2 says Antarctic ozone loss is high and steady around 50, with slight variations. The Arctic has dynamic patterns with peaks in 1996, 2004, 2012, 2020. It attributes Antarctic stability to the ozone hole.\n\nComparing, both agree Antarctic is higher and steadier, Arctic more variable. Text 1's Antarctic peaks at 55% in 2020, Text 2 mentions slight variations around 50. The Arctic in Text 1 peaks at 35% in 2020, Text 2 mentions peaks in specific years including 2020. The key points are consistent: Antarctic steady high loss, Arctic variable with peaks. No contradictions here. Values are in the same ballpark (50 vs 40-60, 35 vs peaks in 2020). So the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\nyes",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details, style, or length. They said to answer only yes or no, but I need to think through it first.\n\nFirst, Text 1 is very detailed. It breaks down the ozone loss percentages in both Antarctic and Arctic regions from 1988 to 2020. It mentions specific ranges: Antarctic 40-60%, Arctic 5-35%. It talks about trends over time, like increases from 1988 to 1995, fluctuations, and a slight upward trend towards 2020. The conclusion emphasizes higher loss in Antarctic, more variability in Arctic, and both having upward trends.\n\nText 2 is more concise. It highlights the disparity, saying Antarctic has persistently high levels (ozone hole), Arctic has lower but sharp increases at irregular intervals (episodic events). It mentions different environmental challenges and tailored approaches.\n\nNow, do they have the same semantic meaning? Let's check for contradictions. Both agree Antarctic has higher ozone loss. Text 1 says Antarctic 40-60%, Arctic 5-35%, which matches Text 2's \"persistently high\" vs \"generally lower\". Text 1 mentions Arctic's variability and upward trend, Text 2 talks about sharp increases episodically. The \"upward trend\" in Text 1 might conflict with \"episodic\" in Text 2 if \"upward trend\" implies a steady increase, but Text 1 also notes variability. However, Text 1's upward trend is slight, peaking at 35% in 2020 for Arctic. Text 2's episodic events could align with the variability mentioned in Text 1. \n\nNo direct contradictions. Both state Antarctic is worse, Arctic has lower but variable. The main points align. So, yes, they have the same semantic meaning.\n</think>\n\nyes"

            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the two texts have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details like style or length. They specifically mention that if there's contradictory information or non-identical shared info, the answer should be 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nLooking at Text 1 first, it's a detailed analysis. The Antarctic ozone loss ranges from 40-60%, Arctic from 5-35%. Both show an upward trend towards 2020, with Antarctic being consistently higher and more stable, while Arctic is more variable. The conclusion is that Antarctic has more severe depletion.\n\nNow Text 2 says that ozone loss in both regions has been steadily decreasing since 1988, with no significant differences. They claim identical patterns and percentages, indicating uniform global recovery.\n\nWait, Text 1 says both regions have an upward trend (increasing ozone loss) towards 2020, peaking higher. Text 2 says they're steadily decreasing. That's a direct contradiction in the trend direction. Also, Text 1 highlights Antarctic is much higher and more severe, while Text 2 says no significant differences. Another contradiction. So even though both talk about ozone loss in the same regions and time frame, the key information about trends and comparison between regions is opposite. Therefore, the answer should be 'no'.\n\nI need to make sure there's no overlap or possible misinterpretation. Text 1's upward trend vs. Text 2's decreasing. Contradiction. Also, Text 2's claim of identical patterns and percentages is directly against Text 1's data. So definitely 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the two texts have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details, style, or length. They said to answer 'no' if there's contradictory info or if shared info isn't identical. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, Text 1 is very detailed. It talks about ozone loss percentages in Antarctic and Arctic from 1988-2020. It mentions specific ranges: Antarctic 40-60%, Arctic 5-35%. It describes trends over time, like increases, fluctuations, and slight upward trends towards 2020. It also states that Antarctic has consistently higher loss and more variability in Arctic. The conclusion is that Antarctic has more severe depletion.\n\nText 2 says there's no discernible pattern or trend. It claims percentages fluctuate randomly with no consistent differences between regions. It suggests ozone depletion is unpredictable and not influenced by geographic/climatic factors.\n\nComparing the two, Text 1 outlines clear trends and differences between regions, while Text 2 says there's no pattern and no consistent differences. That's a direct contradiction. Text 1's upward trends and consistent higher Antarctic loss contradict Text 2's assertion of randomness and no consistent differences. So, they have conflicting information. Therefore, the answer should be 'no'.\n\nWait, but the user said to ignore differences in detail or style. But the problem here is the content contradicts. Text 1 says there are trends and differences, Text 2 says there aren't. That's a contradiction, so 'no' is correct.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the two texts have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details, style, or length. They want a yes/no answer, only saying no if there's a contradiction or values/dates are too far off.\n\nFirst, I'll read both texts carefully. \n\nText 1 is a detailed analysis comparing Antarctic and Arctic ozone loss from 1988 to 2020. It says Antarctic ozone loss is higher (40-60%) and Arctic is lower (5-35%). Antarctic has a slight upward trend by 2020, Arctic also shows an upward trend but with more variability. The conclusion is Antarctic has more severe depletion.\n\nText 2 states the opposite: Arctic has higher, more stable ozone loss, implying it's more affected, while Antarctic has lower, variable percentages. \n\nSo, the key points are the regions' ozone loss levels and trends. Text 1 says Antarctic is higher and more severe; Text 2 claims Arctic is higher and more severe. These are direct contradictions. Even if other elements like time frames or variability are similar, the main conclusions oppose each other. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno"
