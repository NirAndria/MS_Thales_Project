            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring differences in style or length but checking for contradictions or non-identical shared information.\n\nFirst, both texts are about the 2020 White House budget by agency. Text 1 mentions the Department of the Interior's budget as $29.20 billion, leading to approximately 0.62% of the total $4.7 trillion. Text 2 states the Department of the Interior received $12.50 billion, which is 3.76% of the total. \n\nWait, the amounts here are different: 29.2 vs. 12.5 billion. The percentages are also way off\u20140.62% vs. 3.76%. The total budget in Text 1 is 4.7 trillion (4700 billion), while Text 2 mentions mandatory spending as 2.841 trillion and Defense as 750 billion. If I add those two, that's 2.841 + 0.750 = 3.591 trillion, but the total isn't explicitly stated in Text 2. However, the percentage given in Text 2 (3.76%) for 12.5 billion would imply a total budget of around 12.5 / 0.0376 \u2248 332.45 billion, which doesn't align with Text 1's 4700 billion. \n\nThis is a contradiction because the numbers for the Department of the Interior's allocation and the resulting percentages are vastly different. Even if one text rounds and the other doesn't, 0.62% vs. 3.76% is a significant difference. Also, the total budgets implied are way off. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",

The key is to check for contradictions or non-identical shared information.\n\nFirst, both texts discuss the 2020 White House budget by agency, using billions of dollars. Text 1 mentions the Department of the Interior's budget as $29.20 billion, leading to approximately 0.62% of the total $4.7 trillion budget. Text 2 states the Department of the Interior received $12.50 billion, which is 3.76% of the total budget. \n\nWait, the amounts for the Department of the Interior are different: 29.2 vs. 12.5 billion. That's a significant difference. Also, the percentages are 0.62% vs. 3.76%, which are way apart. The total budget in Text 1 is 4.7 trillion (4700 billion), while Text 2 mentions mandatory spending as 2.841 trillion and Defense as 750 billion. If those are parts of the total, maybe the total in Text 2 is 2.841 + 0.750 + others, but the total isn't explicitly stated.

The numbers for both the budget amount and the percentage are conflicting. Even if one rounds, 0.62% vs. 3.76% is too far. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",

The key points to check are whether the information about the Department of the Interior's budget percentage is the same, and if there are any contradictions.\n\nIn Text 1, the Department of the Interior is allocated $29.20 billion out of a total budget of $4.7 trillion (which is 4700 billion). The calculation gives approximately 0.62%. \n\nText 2 states that the Department of the Interior received $25 billion, which is 10.5% of the total budget. Wait, 25 billion being 10.5% would mean the total budget is around 238 billion (since 25 / 0.105 \u2248 238). But Text 2 mentions the total budget includes discretionary spending of 1.2 trillion and Health and Human Services at 200 billion. That seems conflicting because 1.2 trillion plus 200 billion is already 1.4 trillion, which is way more than 238 billion. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nAlso, the percentages are way off: 0.62% vs. 10.5%. The values are too far apart, and the total budgets mentioned are different (4.7 trillion vs. a total that's inconsistent in Text 2). Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",

Text 1 mentions the Department of the Interior's budget as $29.20 billion, leading to approximately 0.62% of the total $4.7 trillion (4700 billion).

The total budgets are also different: Text 1 says 4.7 trillion (4700 billion), while Text 2 mentions discretionary spending as 500 billion and HHS as 300 billion. If those are parts of the total, maybe the total in Text 2 is higher? But the problem is the Department of the Interior's numbers are conflicting. 29.2 vs. 50 billion and 0.62% vs. 10% are way off. Even if one rounds, 0.62% is nowhere near 10%. Also, the total in Text 1 is 4700 billion, but Text 2's total might be different. If the total in Text 2 is 500 billion (discretionary) plus others, maybe the total is higher, but the Department of the Interior's percentage would depend on that. However, Text 2 says the Department of the Interior's 50 billion accounts for 10% of the total. So total would be 50 / 0.10 = 500 billion. But Text 1's total is 4700 billion. That's a huge discrepancy. 500 billion vs. 4700 billion. So the totals are way different, leading to conflicting percentages. Therefore, the information is contradictory.

Even if there's rounding, 29.2 to 50 is too far. Also, the total budgets are different by an order of magnitude (trillion vs. maybe a lower total in Text 2 if 50 is 12%).
