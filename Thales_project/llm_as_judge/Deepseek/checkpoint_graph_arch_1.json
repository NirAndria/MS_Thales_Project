            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring differences in style or detail. The key is to check for contradictions or non-identical shared information.\n\nFirst, both texts are about identifying the most connected group in a network. Text 1 lists steps to analyze group connections by color, counts connections, and concludes Group 5 (Cyan) is the most connected. Text 2 describes the graph with color-coded groups and arrows indicating discussion types. It states Group 7 (green) is the most interconnected, central, with many interactions and blue arrows for positive discussions.\n\nThe main point here is the identified group. Text 1 says Group 5 (Cyan), while Text 2 says Group 7 (green). These are different groups. Even though both discuss methods to determine connectivity, the conclusions contradict each other regarding which group is most connected. Since the answer must be 'no' if there's contradictory information, the answer here should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring differences in detail, style, or length. If there's a contradiction or non-identical shared info, answer 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'. \n\nText 1 is about analyzing a network diagram to find the most connected group. They list steps: identify group colors, count connections, compare. They identify 9 groups with different colors. After counting, they conclude Group 5 (Cyan) is the most connected.\n\nText 2 describes a communication network graph with nodes and arrows indicating discussion direction. Colors distinguish groups, and arrow colors indicate discussion types (blue positive, gray neutral, red negative). It states Group 7 (green) is the most connected, central, with many links and blue arrows suggesting positive interactions. It's a bridge between groups.\n\nSo, both texts are about determining the most connected group in a network. But Text 1 says Group 5 (Cyan) is most connected, while Text 2 says Group 7 (Green). The colors and group numbers are different. Also, Text 2 mentions arrow colors indicating discussion types, which Text 1 doesn't. But the main contradiction is the group identified as most connected. Since they name different groups (5 vs 7), that's a direct contradiction. Therefore, the answer should be 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno"

            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the two texts have the same semantic meaning, ignoring style or length differences. They only care about contradictions or non-identical shared info.\n\nFirst, Text 1 is about determining the most connected group (Group 5 Cyan) by counting connections in a network diagram. The steps involve identifying group colors, counting connections, and comparing them. The conclusion is Group 5 has the most connections.\n\nText 2 describes a disconnected network where groups are isolated. It mentions Group 1 Yellow as the most connected because it's far from the center with few interactions, no conflicts, and dominates communication. It also says Group 7 Green is the least connected.\n\nComparing the main points: Text 1 says Group 5 Cyan is most connected due to dense connections. Text 2 says Group 1 Yellow is most connected because it's dominant with few interactions. These are contradictory. One says Group 5, the other Group 1. Also, Text 2 mentions the network is disconnected with one-way communication, which might not be in Text 1. The conclusions about which group is most connected directly contradict each other. So the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the two texts have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details, style, or length. They mention that if there's contradictory info or non-identical shared info, answer 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'. Values can be rounded, info can be partial. Only say 'no' if there's a contradiction or dates/values are too far apart.\n\nLooking at Text 1: It's a step-by-step guide to determine the most connected group by counting connections. The conclusion is Group 5 (Cyan) is the most connected because of dense clusters and numerous connections.\n\nText 2: Describes a fragmented network with groups mostly interacting within themselves. It mentions Group 1 (yellow) as the most connected because it's on the outskirts with minimal links, suggesting strong influence without external input. Also, Group 7 green is least connected.\n\nWait, Text 1 says Group 5 Cyan is most connected. Text 2 says Group 1 Yellow is most connected. That's a direct contradiction. Even if the reasoning is different (Text 1 counts connections, Text 2 talks about influence and position), the conclusions about which group is most connected are opposite. So they can't both be correct. Therefore, the answer should be 'no' because the main conclusion contradicts.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the two texts have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details, style, or length. They should answer 'no' if there's a contradiction or non-identical shared info, otherwise 'yes'. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the main points of each text.\n\nText 1 is a step-by-step guide to determine the most connected group by counting connections. It identifies Group 5 (Cyan) as the most connected because of dense connections. The steps involve checking colors, counting connections, and comparing. The conclusion is Group 5.\n\nText 2 describes the graph's structure with different arrow colors representing interactions. It states that Group 1 (yellow) is the most engaged because it has the fewest connections, making it influential without interference. Group 7 (green) is least relevant with many arrows. The reasoning here is opposite: fewer connections mean more influence, whereas Text 1 equates more connections (Group 5) with being most connected.\n\nSo, Text 1 says Group 5 (Cyan) is most connected due to many connections. Text 2 says Group 1 (Yellow) is most engaged due to fewest connections. These are contradictory conclusions. Even though both are about group connectivity, the criteria and results oppose each other. Therefore, the answer should be 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno"
