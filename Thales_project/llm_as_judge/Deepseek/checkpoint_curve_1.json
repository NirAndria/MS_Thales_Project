            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details, style, or length. They should answer 'no' if there's contradictory info or non-identical shared info.\n\nFirst, I'll read both texts carefully. \n\nText 1 breaks down the CAC 40's trend since 1987. It mentions starting at 1000 in 1987, peaks in 2000 (6,922), a drop around 2003, another peak in 2007, decline in 2008, recovery by 2015, and a rise to 6,950.68 in 2021. The conclusion is an upward trend despite volatility.\n\nText 2 says the index started at 1,000 in 1987, had sharp increases in 1995 and 2005, followed by declines. It ends at 7,000 in 2021, with an overall upward trend.\n\nNow, check for contradictions. Text 1 mentions specific peaks in 2000, 2007, 2015, and 2021. Text 2 talks about surges in 1995 and 2005. The years of the peaks don't match. Also, Text 1's 2021 peak is 6,950.68, while Text 2 says 7,000. That's a slight difference, but the user says to ignore minor details. However, the years of the surges (1995 vs. 2000, 2005 vs. 2007) are conflicting. Since these are key points in the analysis, they contradict each other. Even if the overall conclusion is upward, the specific events mentioned differ, leading to a 'no' answer.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details, style, or length. They also mention that if there's contradictory info or non-identical shared info, the answer is 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, I need to read both texts carefully.\n\nText 1 breaks down the CAC 40's trend since 1987. It starts at 1000 in 1987, peaks in 2000 at 6,922, drops, peaks again in 2007, then declines in 2008, recovers by 2015, and rises to a new high of 6,950 in 2021. The conclusion is an upward trend despite volatility.\n\nText 2 says the CAC 40 started at 1000 in 1987 and grew to 7000 by 2021. It mentions surges in 1995 and 2005 followed by declines, but overall upward trend.\n\nNow, check for contradictions. Text 1 mentions specific peaks in 2000, 2007, 2015, and 2021. Text 2 talks about surges in 1995 and 2005. These are different years for peaks. Also, Text 1's final value is 6,950 in 2021, while Text 2 says 7,000. That's a slight difference. \n\nBut the user says to ignore differences in detail. However, if the shared information isn't identical, answer 'no'. The key points here are the start and end values. Both start at 1000, but Text 1 ends at ~6,950 and Text 2 at 7,000. That's a discrepancy. Also, the years of the peaks (2000 vs. 1995/2005) are conflicting. Since these are specific data points, even if the overall trend is the same, the differing details in shared info (end value and peak years) would mean the answer is 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details, style, or length.

It starts at 1000 in 1987, peaks in 2000, drops in 2003, peaks again in 2007, then drops in 2008, recovers by 2015, and rises to a new high in 2021. The conclusion is an upward trend despite volatility.\n\nText 2 also talks about CAC 40 from 1987, starting at 1000 and reaching 7000 in 2021. It mentions significant increases in 1995 and 2005 followed by declines but overall a positive trend.\n\nNow, check for contradictions. Text 1 mentions specific peaks in 2000, 2007, and 2021, with a low in 2003 and the 2008 crisis. Text 2 highlights 1995 and 2005 as years with increases followed by declines. The key points in Text 1 don't mention 1995 or 2005 as peak years, which Text 2 does. That's conflicting information. \n\nEven though both agree on the overall upward trend from 1000 to around 7000, the specific years mentioned for peaks and declines differ. Since the user said to say 'no' if there's contradictory info or non-identical shared info, this discrepancy matters. So the answer should be 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno"

They specifically mention that if there's contradictory info or any shared info isn't identical, the answer is 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, I need to read both texts carefully.\n\nText 1 breaks down the CAC 40's trend since 1987. It starts at 1000 in 1987, peaks in 2000 at almost 7k, drops in 2003, peaks again in 2007, then drops in 2008, recovers by 2015, and rises to a new high in 2021 (6950). The conclusion is an upward trend despite volatility.\n\nText 2 says the CAC 40 started at 1000 in 1987 and fell to 3000 in 2021. It mentions sharp declines in 1995 and 2005, followed by increases, but the overall trend is downward.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. Text 1 says the index went up from 1000 to nearly 7000 by 2021, so an upward trend. Text 2 claims it fell from 1000 to 3000, which is a downward trend. Those are direct contradictions. Also, the specific years of declines differ: Text 1 mentions 2000, 2003, 2008, while Text 2 cites 1995 and 2005. The final values are different too (6950 vs 3000). So the key points about the trend direction and the final index value are opposite. Therefore, the answer should be 'no' because they contradict each other on the overall trend and specific data points.\n</think>\n\nno",

Text 1 says the overall trend is upward, starting at 1000 in 1987 and reaching a high of nearly 7000 by 2021. It mentions peaks in 2000, 2007, 2015, and 2021, with some drops but overall growth.\n\nText 2, however, states the overall trend is downward, with the index falling from 1000 to 3000 from 1987 to 2021. It mentions declines in 1995 and 2005 followed by increases but still concludes a downward trend.\n\nWait, that's a direct contradiction. Text 1 says upward, Text 2 says downward. Also, the end values are conflicting: Text 1 ends at ~6950, Text 2 at 3000. Even if other details are ignored, the main conclusion and the final numbers are opposites. So they can't have the same semantic meaning. Answer should be 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",

Text 2 says it fell to 3000 in 2021. That's a direct contradiction in the final value and the overall trend. Text 1 says upward, Text 2 says negative (downward). So even though both mention volatility and some peaks and troughs, the conclusion about the trend is opposite. Therefore, they contradict each other. The answer should be 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno"
