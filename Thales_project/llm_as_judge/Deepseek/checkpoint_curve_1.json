            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring differences in detail, style, or length. Contradictions or non-identical shared info mean 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'. Values can be rounded, partial info is okay. Only say 'no' if there's a contradiction or dates/values are too far.\n\nText 1 starts by breaking down the CAC 40's trend since 1987. It mentions starting at 1000 in 1987, peaks in 2000 (6,922.33), a drop around 2003, another peak in 2007, decline in 2008, recovery to 2015, rise from 2016 to a record high of 6,950.68 in 2021. The conclusion is an upward trend overall.\n\nText 2 says the CAC 40 started at 1,000 in 1987 and rose to 7,000 in 2021. It mentions sharp increases in 1995 and 2005 followed by declines. The overall trend is upward.\n\nComparing key points: Both agree on starting at 1000 in 1987 and ending around 7000 in 2021. Text 1's 2021 peak is 6,950.68, which rounds to 7,000, so that's okay. Text 1 mentions peaks in 2000, 2007, 2015, and 2021. Text 2 mentions surges in 1995 and 2005. These are different years for peaks. However, the question says to ignore differences in detail and partial info. The main point is the overall upward trend. The contradiction here is that Text 1 doesn't mention 1995 or 2005 surges, while Text 2 doesn't mention 2000, 2007, or 2015 peaks. But since the user says to ignore partial info, maybe that's okay. However, if the surges in Text 2 (1995 and 2005) are significant events that aren't mentioned in Text 1, does that create a contradiction? The user says if any shared info is not identical, answer 'no'. Wait, the instruction says \"if they contain contradictory information or any shared information is not identical, answer 'no'\". So if there's a shared point that's different, then 'no'. But in this case, the starting and ending points are the same. The peaks mentioned in each text are different. But since they don't contradict each other, just provide different details, maybe it's okay. The main conclusion is the same: upward trend. The user says to ignore differences in detail, style, or length. So even if one text mentions different peaks than the other, as long as there's no contradiction, it's okay. The key is whether the shared information is identical. The start and end values are the same (1000 to ~7000). The overall trend is upward. The different peaks (2000 vs 1995 and 2005) are additional details, but since the user says to ignore differences in detail, maybe that's acceptable. However, if the peaks in Text 2 (1995 and 2005) are not mentioned in Text 1, but Text 1 mentions different peaks, does that count as contradictory? For example, if Text 1 says a peak in 2000 and Text 2 says a surge in 1995, but Text 1 doesn't mention 1995, is that a contradiction? The user says to answer 'no' if there's contradictory information or if shared info isn't identical. Since the peaks mentioned are different, but not necessarily contradictory, maybe it's okay. The main point is the overall upward trend. The user also says to answer 'no' only if there's a contradiction or dates/values are too far. The dates here (1995 vs 2000) are different, but the user allows partial info. So maybe the answer is 'yes' because the main conclusion is the same, and the differences in specific peaks are details that can be ignored. The key is that there's no contradiction in the shared information. Both agree on the start and end points and the upward trend. The different peaks don't contradict each other; they just add different details. Therefore, the answer should be 'yes'.\n</think>\n\nyes",

The conclusion is an upward trend.\n\nText 2 says the CAC 40 started in 1987, from 1,000 to 7,000 by 2021. Mentions surges in 1995 and 2005 followed by declines. Overall upward trend despite fluctuations.\n\nComparing key points: Both agree on starting at 1000 in 1987 and ending around 7000 in 2021. Text 1's 2021 peak is 6,950.68, which is close to 7,000 when rounded. Text 2 mentions surges in 1995 and 2005, which aren't in Text 1. Text 1 talks about peaks in 2000, 2007, 2015, and 2021. The years don't match exactly, but the question says to ignore differences in detail or partial info. The main point is the overall upward trend. The end values are close (6,950 vs 7,000), which is acceptable. The surges in different years (1995, 2005 vs 2000, 2007, etc.) don't contradict each other; they're just different examples of fluctuations. Since there's no contradiction in the main trend or the start/end values, and the differences in mentioned years are just additional details, the answer should be 'yes'.\n</think>\n\nyes",

Text 1's 2021 peak is 6950.68, which is close to 7000 in Text 2. Rounding makes that okay. \n\nText 1 mentions peaks in 2000, 2007, 2015, and 2021, with declines in 2000-2003, 2008. Text 2 mentions increases in 1995 and 2005 followed by declines. The years of peaks and declines differ. Text 1 doesn't mention 1995 or 2005 as significant points. However, the overall conclusion in both is an upward trend. \n\nAre the differing peak years (2000 vs. 1995/2005) contradictory? The question says to ignore differences in detail or partial info. Since both agree on the overall upward trend and the start/end values, the specific peaks mentioned might be additional details. However, if Text 2's 1995 and 2005 peaks are not mentioned in Text 1, but Text 1 talks about 2000, 2007, etc., does that create a contradiction? \n\nThe key is whether the shared information is identical. The start and end points are the same. The overall trend is the same. The differing peaks in the middle might be considered additional details rather than contradictions. Since the user says to ignore differences in detail or partial info, and only answer 'no' if there's a contradiction or values are too far. The 2021 values are close (6950 vs 7000). The other peaks are different years, but since the main trend is upward, maybe that's okay. \n\nBut wait, Text 1 says the index reached a peak in 2000 (6922), then a low around 2003, another peak in 2007, then 2015, then 2021. Text 2 says significant increases in 1995 and 2005 followed by declines. The peaks in different years could be conflicting. For example, Text 1's 2000 peak isn't mentioned in Text 2, and Text 2's 1995 and 2005 peaks aren't in Text 1. However, since the user says to ignore differences in detail or partial info, maybe these are just different details mentioned but not contradictory. The main point is the overall upward trend. \n\nBut if the peaks are in different years, does that count as contradictory information? For example, if one text says a peak in 2000 and another in 1995, that's conflicting. But since the user says to answer 'no' only if there's a contradiction or values are too far. The peaks in different years might be considered contradictory because they refer to different events. However, the user also says to ignore differences in detail. If the main conclusion is the same (upward trend), then maybe it's okay. \n\nAlternatively, if the peaks are in different years, that could be a contradiction in the information presented. For example, Text 1's 2000 peak vs. Text 2's 1995 and 2005 peaks. But since the user allows partial information, maybe one text just includes different key points. The main question is whether the shared information is identical. The start and end points are the same. The trend is the same. The differing peaks might not be contradictory but just different details. \n\nSo, since the main conclusion is the same (upward trend), start and end values are consistent (1000 to ~7000), and the differing peaks are additional details, the answer would be 'yes'. The differences in specific peak years are considered details to be ignored. There's no direct contradiction in the overall trend or the start/end values. The peaks mentioned are different, but not contradictory because they could be different events. Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.\n</think>\n\nyes"

Text 2 mentions the index fell from 1000 in 1987 to 3000 in 2021, claiming a downward trend. \n\nWait, that's a contradiction. Text 1's conclusion is an upward trend with a high of nearly 7000, while Text 2 states it fell to 3000, which is a much lower value. Even if we consider rounding, 3000 vs 6950 is a huge difference. Also, the final conclusions about the trend direction are opposite: upward vs downward. That's a direct contradiction. So the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",

Wait, that's a contradiction. The first text says it went up to almost 7000, the second says it went down to 3000. Those end values are way different.
