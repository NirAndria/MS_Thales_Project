The main thing is whether there's a contradiction or if the values are too different.\n\nIn Text 1, the process described is finding rows where Key1=10 and Key2=110 in both tables. They get Value1=30 from the left table and Value2=30 from the right table. The average is (30+30)/2 = 30. So the result is 30.\n\nText 2 talks about doing an inner join on Key1 and Key2, then averaging Value1 and Value2 for the same keys. But here, the mean is 25. Wait, that's different from 30. So the result in Text 1 is 30, Text 2 says 25. That's a contradiction because the values are different. Even if one text is more detailed, the final numbers don't match. Since 25 and 30 are not close (like if one was 30 and the other 30.5, maybe rounding, but 5 difference is significant), the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",

The main thing is whether there's a contradiction or if the values are too different.\n\nIn Text 1, the process is described step by step. They look for Key1=10 and Key2=110 in both tables. From the left table, Value1 is 30, and from the right table, Value2 is 30. Then they average them: (30+30)/2 = 30. The result is 30.\n\nText 2 says that after an inner join on Key1 and Key2, the average for the same keys is 25. Wait, that's different. Text 1 says 30, Text 2 says 25. Those are conflicting results. Even if one rounds, 25 and 30 are five apart. Depending on context, maybe that's a big difference. The user mentioned if values are \"too far,\" but didn't specify a threshold. But 25 vs. 30 is a 20% difference. That seems significant. Also, they are exact numbers here, not rounded versions of each other. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",

Then the average is calculated as (30+30)/2 = 30. So the mean is 30.\n\nText 2 talks about the same keys, Key1=10 and Key2=110, but states the mean is 25. That's a direct contradiction because 30 vs. 25 are different. Even if there's rounding, 25 is not a rounded version of 30. The values are too far apart. So the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno"

The main thing is whether there's a contradiction or if values are too far apart.\n\nText 1 says that for Key1=10 and Key2=110, the mean value is 30. It explains that Value1 is 30 from the left table and Value2 is 30 from the right table. Then averaging them gives 30.\n\nText 2 mentions that after a left join on Key1 and Key2, averaging Value1 and Value2 for the same keys gives a mean of 75. \n\nWait, the key point here is the result. Text 1 says 30, Text 2 says 75. Those are different numbers. Even if there's a different method mentioned, like a left join, the final calculated value is conflicting. Since 30 and 75 are not close and are contradictory, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details like style or length. The main thing is to check for contradictions or non-identical shared information.\n\nFirst, looking at Text 1: It's about calculating the mean value for Key1=10 and Key2=110. The steps involve finding rows with those keys in both tables, extracting Value1 and Value2 (both 30), averaging them to get 30.\n\nText 2 mentions Key1=15 and Key2=120, and the mean is 75. The process here is a left join on Key1 and Key2, summing Value1 and Value2 for matching pairs, then taking the mean. \n\nSo the keys are different: 10 vs 15 and 110 vs 120. The mean results are 30 vs 75. Since the keys and the resulting values are different, this is a contradiction. Even if the method is similar, the actual data points and outcomes don't match. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if the two texts have the same semantic meaning, ignoring style and details. The key is to check for contradictions or major differences in values.\n\nText 1 explains that for Key1=10 and Key2=110, they take Value1=30 from the left table and Value2=30 from the right table. Then they average them: (30+30)/2 = 30. So the mean is 30.\n\nText 2 says that after a left join on Key1 and Key2, the sum of Value1 and Value2 for the same keys is computed, and the resulting mean is 50. Wait, sum vs average? The user mentions \"compute the sum... the resulting mean\". Hmm, maybe they sum the values and then take the mean? If the sum is 100, then the mean would be 50 if divided by 2. But in Text 1, the sum is 60, leading to a mean of 30. So Text 2's result is 50, which is different from 30. That's a contradiction. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno"
