            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to know if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring differences in detail, style, or length. But if there's contradictory information or any shared info isn't identical, the answer should be 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both texts thoroughly.\n\nStarting with Text 1. It describes a process to find the mean column value for Key1=10 and Key2=110. The steps are: identify rows in both tables with those keys, extract Value1 and Value2, then average them. From the left table, Value1 is 30, and from the right table, Value2 is also 30. The calculation is (30+30)/2 = 30. So the mean is 30.\n\nNow Text 2. It mentions two tables with Key1, Key2, and values. If you do an inner join on Key1 and Key2, then average Value1 and Value2 for the same key pairs, the mean for Key1=10 and Key2=110 is 25.\n\nWait, the key point here is the result. Text 1 says 30, Text 2 says 25. That's a direct contradiction. Even if the process described is similar, the final results differ. The user instruction says to check if there's contradictory information. Since the mean values are different (30 vs. 25), that's a contradiction. Therefore, the answer should be 'no'.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a misunderstanding. Let me parse both texts again.\n\nText 1's calculation is straightforward: both values are 30, average is 30. Text 2's result is 25. Unless there's a scenario where the inner join might result in different values, but according to Text 1, both tables have the same keys leading to 30 each. If Text 2's inner join somehow found different values, like maybe multiple rows with the same keys but different values, but Text 1 only found one each. But according to Text 1's description, they found one row in each table with those keys, each with 30. So if Text 2's inner join also found those same rows, the average should be 30. But Text 2 says 25. Therefore, the results contradict each other. Hence, the answer is 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",

Text 1 says 30, Text 2 says 25. That's a direct contradiction in the outcome. Even if the process described is similar (using inner join, averaging values), the final results differ.

Both are about calculating the average of Value1 and Value2 after joining tables on Key1 and Key2. The key point here is the result. Text 1 says 30, Text 2 says 25. That's a direct contradiction in the numerical result. Even though the process described is similar (inner join, averaging), the final answers differ. Since the question says to check for contradictory information, this difference in the mean value (30 vs. 25) means they are not the same semantically. The answer should be 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno"

            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants to know if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details like style or length. The key is whether they contain contradictory information or if any shared info isn't identical.\n\nFirst, I'll look at Text 1. It describes a process to find the mean value for Key1=10 and Key2=110. The steps are: identify the rows in both tables with those keys, extract Value1 and Value2, then average them. From the left table, Value1 is 30, and from the right table, Value2 is 30. The calculation is (30+30)/2 = 30. So the mean is 30.\n\nNow, Text 2 mentions that after performing a left join on Key1 and Key2, averaging Value1 and Value2 for the same keys gives a mean of 75. Wait, that's different. Text 1 says 30, Text 2 says 75. That's a direct contradiction in the result. Even if the process was similar, the final numbers don't match. \n\nThe instructions say to answer 'no' if there's contradictory information. Since the mean values are different (30 vs. 75), they contradict each other. Even if the method was the same, the outcome isn't identical. So the answer should be 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",

They specifically mention that if there's contradictory information or if shared info isn't identical, the answer should be 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, I'll read through both texts carefully.\n\nText 1 is about calculating the mean column value for Key1=10 and Key2=110. The steps involve finding rows with those keys in two tables, extracting Value1 and Value2 (both 30), averaging them to get 30.\n\nText 2 mentions two tables with Key1, Key2, Key3. It talks about a left join on Key1 and Key2, summing Value1 and Value2 for matching pairs, and states the mean for Key1=15 and Key2=120 is 75.\n\nNow, comparing the two. The main points to check are the keys and the result. Text 1 uses Key1=10 and Key2=110, resulting in mean 30. Text 2 uses Key1=15 and Key2=120, resulting in mean 75. The keys are different, and the results are different. Even though both discuss calculating a mean using similar methods (joining tables, summing values), the specific keys and outcomes contradict each other. Since the problem says to answer 'no' if there's contradictory information, the answer here should be 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",

It mentions doing a left join on those keys and computing the sum of Value1 and Value2 for matching pairs. The mean for Key1=10 and Key2=110 is said to be 50. Wait, mean here\u2014if they compute the sum and then take the mean, but the sum would be 30+30=60, so the mean would be 60/2=30. But Text 2 says the mean is 50. That's a contradiction. Unless Text 2 is using a different method, like maybe summing and not averaging? Let me check again.\n\nText 2 says \"compute the sum of Value1 and Value2 for identical Key1 and Key2 pairs, the resulting mean... would equal 50.\" Wait, that's confusing. If they sum Value1 and Value2, that's 30+30=60. Then the mean (average) would be 60/2=30. But Text 2 says the mean is 50. That's a direct contradiction. So the results are different: 30 vs. 50. Therefore, the answer should be 'no' because the outcomes are contradictory.\n</think>\n\nno"
