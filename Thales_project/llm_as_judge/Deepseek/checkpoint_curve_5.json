If there's a contradiction or non-identical shared info, answer 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, Text 1 says the test loss at epoch 80 is around 0.35. Text 2 says the loss is below 0.1. That's a big difference. 0.35 vs. below 0.1. Those values are too far apart. Even if rounding is allowed, 0.35 can't be rounded to 0.1. So that's a contradiction in the loss value.\n\nThen, accuracy in Text 1 is approximately 0.75, while Text 2 says 0.8. 0.75 vs. 0.8. If we consider rounding, 0.75 could round to 0.8, but the problem says if values are too far, answer 'no'. But 0.75 to 0.8 is a 0.05 difference. Maybe that's acceptable? But the loss difference is definitely too big. So even if the accuracy is close, the loss is contradictory. Therefore, the answer should be 'no'.\n\nWait, the instructions say to answer 'no' if there's a contradiction or if dates/values are too far. So even one of them being contradictory is enough. Since the loss values are way off, that's a contradiction. So the answer is 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring style or length. The key points are about the loss and accuracy at epoch 80.\n\nIn Text 1, the loss is around 0.35 and accuracy is about 0.75. Text 2 says the loss is below 0.1 and accuracy is 0.8. The loss values are 0.35 vs. below 0.1\u2014those are quite different. Even if we consider rounding, 0.35 rounded to one decimal place would be 0.4, which is way higher than 0.1. The accuracy is 0.75 vs. 0.8. That's a 0.05 difference. Depending on context, maybe that's considered close, but the loss difference is significant. Since the loss values are too far apart, there's a contradiction. So the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details like style or length. The key is to check for contradictions or significant differences in values.\n\nIn Text 1, the accuracy at epoch 80 is approximately 0.75, and the loss is around 0.35. Text 2 states the loss is under 0.1 and accuracy is 0.8. \n\nFirst, the accuracy: 0.75 vs. 0.8. That's a difference of 0.05. The question says if values are too far, answer no. But how much is too far? The instructions mention rounding is allowed. If 0.75 rounds to 0.8, maybe it's okay. But 0.75 is 75%, and 0.8 is 80%, which is a 5% difference. Depending on context, that might be considered a significant difference, but the problem says to ignore partial information. However, the loss values are 0.35 vs. under 0.1. That's a big difference. 0.35 is more than three times higher than 0.1. That's a contradiction because one says the loss is around 0.35, the other says under 0.1. So these are conflicting numbers. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno"

If there's a contradiction or non-identical shared info, answer 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'. \n\nText 1 talks about epoch 80. It mentions test set accuracy around 0.75 and loss around 0.35 at that epoch. Text 2 refers to epoch 8, with loss over 10 and accuracy below 0.08. \n\nWait, the epochs are different: 80 vs. 8. That's a big difference. Also, the loss and accuracy values are way off. Text 1's loss is 0.35 at epoch 80, Text 2's loss is over 10 at epoch 8. Accuracy in Text 1 is 0.75, Text 2 is below 0.08. These are contradictory in both values and epochs. So they can't be the same.

            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details like style or length. They should only answer 'no' if there's a contradiction or if dates/values are too far apart.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the key numbers in both texts. Text 1 says that at epoch 80, the test accuracy is around 0.75 and the loss is about 0.35. Text 2 mentions epoch 8, test loss over 10, and accuracy of 0.08. \n\nWait, the epochs are different: 80 vs. 8. That's a big difference. Epoch numbers are crucial here because they indicate when the measurements were taken. If one text is talking about epoch 80 and the other about epoch 8, the values can't be the same. \n\nAlso, the loss in Text 2 is over 10, which is way higher than 0.35 in Text 1. Similarly, the accuracy in Text 2 is 0.08, which is much lower than 0.75. These numbers are not just slightly different; they're orders of magnitude apart. \n\nEven if we consider rounding, 0.35 vs. 10 is a huge gap. The same with accuracy: 0.75 vs. 0.08. These are contradictory. So, the answer should be 'no' because the epoch numbers are different and the metrics are conflicting.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details like style or length. The key is to check for contradictions or significant differences in values.\n\nText 1 says that at epoch 80, the test accuracy is around 0.75 and the loss is about 0.35. Text 2 states that by epoch 80, the test loss is below 0.1 and accuracy is 0.8. \n\nSo, comparing the numbers: loss in Text 1 is 0.35 vs. Text 2's below 0.1. That's a big difference. Even allowing for rounding, 0.35 is way higher than 0.1. Similarly, accuracy is 0.75 vs. 0.8. The accuracy difference is smaller, but the loss is a major discrepancy. Since the loss values are too far apart, this is a contradiction. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno"
