            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details like style or length. The main point is whether they contain the same core information without contradictions.\n\nLooking at Text 1, it's about determining the ERP code for a specific screw (M8 diameter, 65mm length). The conclusion is that the ERP code is 998371. The text mentions analyzing a table with attributes like TYPE, MATIERE, DIAMETRE, and COTE columns. The key info here is the ERP code 998371 for those screws.\n\nText 2 also states that M8 screws with 65mm length have ERP code 998371. It goes into more detail about what an ERP code is, its purpose in inventory management, procurement, etc. But the main fact is the same: the ERP code for those screws is 998371.\n\nEven though Text 2 provides additional context about ERP codes and their uses, the core information about the screw specifications and the assigned ERP code matches Text 1. There's no contradiction in the numbers or details. The extra explanation in Text 2 doesn't conflict with Text 1's statement. Both agree on the ERP code for the given screw dimensions. So the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\nyes",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the two texts have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details, style, or length. They mention that if there's contradictory info or non-identical shared info, answer 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'. Also, values can be rounded, and partial info is okay. Only say 'no' if there's a contradiction or dates/values are too far apart.\n\nLooking at Text 1: It's about determining the ERP code (998371) for an M8 screw that's 65mm long. The text breaks down the attributes from a table, focusing on type, material, diameter, length, and the resulting ERP code.\n\nText 2: Discusses an M8 screw with 65mm length but adds a dimension h of 3.5mm. It explains what the dimensions mean, like the M8 diameter, 65mm length, and the 3.5mm possibly being head height or thread depth. There's no mention of an ERP code here.\n\nSo, Text 1's main point is the ERP code for the screw. Text 2 doesn't mention the ERP code at all; instead, it talks about the 3.5mm dimension. Since Text 1 provides a specific code and Text 2 provides a different specification (3.5mm), they don't share the same information. There's no direct contradiction, but the shared info isn't identical because one has the code and the other has a dimension. However, the user said to ignore differences in detail, style, or length. But the problem is that Text 2 introduces a new value (3.5mm) that's not in Text 1. Since the ERP code is the main point of Text 1 and Text 2 doesn't mention it, but adds another detail, they aren't conveying the same semantic meaning. The absence of the ERP code in Text 2 and the presence of the 3.5mm dimension not in Text 1 means they don't share identical information. Therefore, the answer should be 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring differences in detail, style, or length. The key is to check for contradictions or non-identical shared information.\n\nText 1 talks about a specific screw (M8 diameter, 65mm length) made of steel, with the ERP code 998371. It breaks down the attributes from a table and concludes the ERP code is correct.\n\nText 2 also discusses screws with M8 diameter and 65mm length made of steel. It elaborates on the material properties, applications, and benefits of steel screws but doesn't mention the ERP code at all.\n\nThe main point here is that Text 1 provides the ERP code, while Text 2 doesn't. Since ERP code is specific information present in Text 1 but absent in Text 2, does that count as a contradiction or non-identical shared info? The instructions say if any shared information isn't identical, answer 'no'. However, the ERP code isn't mentioned in Text 2, so there's no contradiction. But the problem states that if shared information isn't identical, answer 'no'. Wait, but the ERP code is only in Text 1. Since Text 2 doesn't mention it, there's no conflict. However, the user says to answer 'no' if any shared information is not identical. But the ERP code isn't shared; it's only in Text 1. The shared info (M8, 65mm, steel) is present in both. The ERP code is additional info in Text 1. Since the question is about whether they have the same semantic meaning, and the ERP code is a specific detail in Text 1 that's not in Text 2, but Text 2 doesn't contradict it. The instructions say to ignore differences in detail, style, or length. So if the main points (M8, 65mm, steel) are the same, and there's no contradiction, then it's 'yes'. The ERP code is extra info in Text 1, but since Text 2 doesn't mention it, there's no conflict. Therefore, the answer should be 'yes'.\n</think>\n\nyes"

            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring differences in style or detail. The main points to check are the ERP codes.\n\nIn Text 1, the ERP code given for the M8, 65mm screw is 998371. Text 2 says the ERP code is 998363. These are different numbers. Even if other details like type (hex head), material (steel) are the same, the ERP codes don't match. Since the ERP codes are conflicting, that's a direct contradiction. The answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring differences in detail, style, or length. If there's contradictory info or non-identical shared info, answer 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, Text 1 talks about a screw with M8 diameter, 65mm length, and gives the ERP code as 998371. It mentions the type (hex head), material (steel), and the code. The conclusion is that the ERP code is 998371 for those specs.\n\nText 2 also discusses M8 diameter and 65mm length screws. It adds that they have a dimension h of 4mm, important for compatibility with nuts, washers, etc. \n\nNow, do they share the same core information? Both mention M8 and 65mm length. But Text 1's main point is the ERP code, while Text 2 introduces a dimension h of 4mm. The ERP code isn't mentioned in Text 2, and the dimension h isn't in Text 1. \n\nAre these contradictory? Not directly. But the problem says if any shared info isn't identical, answer 'no'. Wait, the instructions say to ignore differences in detail, style, or length. But if there's additional info in one that's not in the other, but not conflicting, does that matter? The key is if the shared info is identical. Both agree on M8 and 65mm. But Text 1's ERP code is specific to that combination, while Text 2 adds h=4mm. Since the ERP code in Text 1 is part of the conclusion, and Text 2 doesn't mention it, but adds another attribute, there's no contradiction. However, the question is whether the shared information is identical. The shared info is M8 and 65mm, which are the same. But the ERP code in Text 1 is part of the main conclusion, and Text 2's h=4mm is new. Since the ERP code isn't mentioned in Text 2, and Text 2's h isn't in Text 1, but they don't contradict each other. However, the user's instruction says if any shared information is not identical, answer 'no'. Wait, the shared info here is M8 and 65mm. Both have that. The other details (ERP code vs. h=4mm) are additional. Since the user says to ignore differences in detail, style, or length, and only answer 'no' if there's contradiction or if dates/values are too far. The values here (M8, 65mm) are the same. The other info (ERP code, h=4mm) are additional, not conflicting. So, since there's no contradiction, and the shared info (M8, 65mm) is identical, the answer should be 'yes'.\n\nWait, but the user says \"if they contain contradictory information or any shared information is not identical, answer 'no'\". Wait, the shared information here is M8 and 65mm. Both texts agree on that. The other info (ERP code and h=4mm) are not shared between them. So the shared info is identical. Therefore, the answer is 'yes'.\n</think>\n\nyes",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the two texts have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details, style, or length. But if there's contradictory info or non-identical shared info, answer 'no'.\n\nLooking at Text 1: It's about a hexagonal head screw made of steel (MATIERE: ACIER), M8 diameter, 65mm length. The ERP code is 998371. The conclusion is that the ERP code for that specific screw is 998371.\n\nText 2: Same diameter and length (M8, 65mm), but the material is aluminum. It mentions use in aerospace, automotive, etc., because of lightweight and corrosion resistance.\n\nSo the key points here are the material. Text 1 says steel, Text 2 says aluminum. That's a direct contradiction in material. Even though other details like ERP code vs. applications are different, the shared attribute (material) is conflicting. Therefore, the answer should be 'no'.\n\nWait, the user said to ignore differences in detail, style, or length, but if there's a contradiction, answer 'no'. Since the material is different (steel vs. aluminum), that's a contradiction. Even if other info is partial or not mentioned, the material here is a key shared attribute that's conflicting. So definitely 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno"
