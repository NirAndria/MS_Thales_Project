            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details, style, or length. They also mention that if there's contradictory info or non-identical shared info, answer 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, I need to read both texts carefully.\n\nText 1 is about determining the correct ERP code for a screw with M8 diameter and 65mm length. It breaks down the table's columns, identifies the relevant row with M8 and 65mm, and concludes the ERP code is 998371.\n\nText 2 states that the same screws (M8, 65mm) have ERP code 998371. It then explains what an ERP code is, its purpose in inventory management, procurement, tracking, etc. It elaborates on how the code helps with stock management, ordering, avoiding confusion, supply chain, quality control, etc.\n\nNow, the key point is whether the core information about the ERP code for those screws is the same. Both texts agree that the ERP code is 998371 for M8, 65mm screws. Text 2 adds a lot of explanatory details about ERP codes in general, but the main fact (the code number) is the same. There's no contradiction in the shared information. The extra details in Text 2 don't conflict with Text 1; they just provide more context. Since the user says to ignore differences in detail, style, or length, and focus on whether the shared info is identical and non-contradictory, the answer should be 'yes'.\n</think>\n\nyes",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details, style, or length. But if there's contradictory info or non-identical shared info, answer 'no'. \n\nFirst, I'll read both texts carefully.\n\nText 1 is about determining the correct ERP code (998371) for an M8 screw that's 65mm long. It mentions analyzing a table with attributes like type, material, diameter, and length. The conclusion is the ERP code based on those specs.\n\nText 2 talks about the same M8, 65mm screw but focuses on a dimension h of 3.5mm. It explains what the 3.5mm could mean (head height, thread depth, etc.), and discusses the importance of these dimensions for compatibility and performance. There's no mention of an ERP code here.\n\nNow, do they have the same semantic meaning? Both are about M8 screws of 65mm length. But Text 1's main point is the ERP code, while Text 2 is about the h dimension. The shared info is the screw specs (M8, 65mm), but Text 1 adds ERP code, Text 2 adds h=3.5mm. Since they introduce different pieces of information and don't contradict each other, but the question says if any shared info isn't identical or if there's contradiction. Wait, the shared info here is M8 and 65mm, which are identical. But the problem is that Text 1's conclusion is about ERP code, and Text 2's is about dimension h. Since they don't contradict each other but provide different information, but the instructions say if any shared info is not identical, answer 'no'. Wait, the shared info (M8, 65mm) is identical. However, the user says to ignore differences in detail, style, or length. But if they contain contradictory information or any shared info is not identical, answer 'no'. \n\nWait, the key here is whether the shared information is identical. Both texts agree on M8 and 65mm. However, Text 1's main point is the ERP code, and Text 2's main point is the h dimension. Since they don't contradict each other but add different details, but the question says to ignore differences in detail. However, the user's instruction says if they contain contradictory information or any shared information is not identical, answer 'no'. Since the shared info (M8, 65mm) is identical, but they add different details. But the problem is that the user says to ignore differences in detail, style, or length. So the main question is: do the texts have the same semantic meaning despite different details? But the answer should be 'no' if there's contradictory info or if shared info isn't identical. Since the shared info is identical, but they present different additional info. However, the user's instruction says to answer 'no' if any shared information is not identical. Wait, the shared information here is M8 and 65mm, which are identical. The other details (ERP code vs. h dimension) are not shared between them, so they don't conflict. Therefore, since the shared info is identical and there's no contradiction, the answer should be 'yes'. But wait, the user's instruction says \"if they contain contradictory information or any shared information is not identical, answer 'no'\". So if the shared info is identical, even if there's additional info, it's 'yes'. But in this case, the two texts are talking about different aspects of the same screw. Text 1 is about ERP code, Text 2 about dimension h. Since they don't contradict each other and the shared info (M8, 65mm) is the same, the answer should be 'yes'. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again. The user says to ignore differences in detail, style, or length. So even if one text adds more details, as long as the core semantic meaning is the same, it's 'yes'. But in this case, the core meaning is different. Text 1 is identifying the ERP code, Text 2 is explaining a dimension. They are both about the same screw but discussing different attributes. So the semantic meaning isn't the same. They are providing different information about the same subject. Therefore, the answer should be 'no' because they don't have the same semantic meaning. The first is about ERP code, the second about a dimension. Even though they share the same screw specs, the main point is different. So the answer is 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details, style, or length. They also mention that if there's contradictory info or non-identical shared info, answer 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both texts.\n\nText 1 is about determining the correct ERP code (998371) for a specific screw (M8 diameter, 65mm length) by analyzing a table. It mentions the type (hex head), material (steel), diameter, length, and the resulting ERP code.\n\nText 2 talks about the same screw (M8, 65mm, steel) but focuses on the material properties of steel, why it's used, applications in various industries, and benefits like strength, durability, corrosion resistance. It doesn't mention the ERP code at all.\n\nNow, check for contradictions or non-identical shared info. Both agree on the screw specs: M8, 65mm, steel. But Text 1's main point is the ERP code, which Text 2 doesn't reference. Text 2's focus is on material benefits and applications, which Text 1 doesn't discuss beyond stating the material. \n\nSince the user says to ignore differences in detail, style, or length, but if there's any contradictory info or shared info isn't identical, answer 'no'. Here, the shared info (screw specs) is identical. However, Text 1 adds ERP code, which Text 2 doesn't mention. The question is whether the ERP code is considered \"shared information\". Since Text 2 doesn't mention it, but Text 1 does, they aren't contradicting, but the presence of additional unique info in one text might not affect the answer unless it's conflicting. The instructions say if any shared info is not identical, answer 'no'. But the shared info here (M8, 65mm, steel) is identical. The ERP code is extra in Text 1, but since the user says to ignore differences in detail, maybe that's okay. Wait, but the ERP code is a specific fact in Text 1. If Text 2 doesn't mention it, does that count as contradictory? No, because Text 2 isn't talking about codes. So the shared info (screw attributes) are the same. The ERP code is additional, not conflicting. Therefore, the answer would be 'yes'? Wait, but the user says if any shared information is not identical. Since the ERP code is part of Text 1's conclusion, but Text 2 doesn't have it, but the shared info (screw specs) are the same. The ERP code isn't part of the shared info because Text 2 doesn't mention it. So the shared info is the screw's diameter, length, material. Those are identical. The rest is additional, not conflicting. Therefore, the answer is 'yes'? Or does the presence of the ERP code in Text 1 and absence in Text 2 count as non-identical shared info? Wait, the user says \"any shared information is not identical\". If the ERP code is part of the information in Text 1, but Text 2 doesn't mention it, but the user says to ignore differences in detail, style, or length. So maybe the ERP code is a detail that's being ignored. The main point is whether the semantic meaning is the same. Text 1's main point is identifying the ERP code for the screw. Text 2's main point is explaining the material and applications. Since they don't contradict, but they don't share the same main point, but the user says to ignore differences in style, etc. Wait, the instructions are a bit confusing. The key is: if they have contradictory info or any shared info is not identical, answer 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'. So even if one text has more info, as long as the shared parts are identical and no contradictions, it's 'yes'. Here, the shared info (M8, 65mm, steel) is identical. The ERP code in Text 1 and the material discussion in Text 2 are additional, not conflicting. Therefore, the answer is 'yes' because the shared parts are the same and no contradictions. But wait, the user says \"ignore differences in detail, style, or length\". So the ERP code is a detail, so we ignore that. Then, the core semantic meaning is about the screw's attributes. Both texts agree on M8, 65mm, steel. So 'yes'. But Text 1's conclusion is about the ERP code, which Text 2 doesn't mention. But since we're supposed to ignore differences in detail, maybe the ERP code is a detail. So the answer is 'yes'.\n</think>\n\nyes"

They specifically mention that if there's contradictory information or if any shared info isn't identical, the answer should be 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, I'll read both texts carefully.\n\nText 1 talks about determining the correct ERP code for a screw with M8 diameter and 65mm length. It breaks down the attributes: type, material, diameter, length. It references a table and concludes that the ERP code is 998371.\n\nText 2 states that the same type of screw (M8, 65mm) is registered under ERP code 998363. It also mentions inventory management benefits.\n\nThe key point here is the ERP code. Text 1 says 998371, Text 2 says 998363. These are different numbers. Even though the rest of the information about the screw's attributes matches, the ERP codes are conflicting. Since the ERP codes are different and they are a central piece of information in both texts, this is a direct contradiction. \n\nThe user's instruction says to answer 'no' if there's contradictory information.

But if there's contradictory info or any shared info isn't identical, answer 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, Text 1 is about determining the correct ERP code (998371) for a hexagonal head screw made of steel with M8 diameter and 65mm length. It mentions analyzing a table with TYPE, MATIERE, DIAMETRE, and COTE columns. The key point here is the ERP code.\n\nText 2 talks about the same screws (M8, 65mm) but adds that they have a dimension h of 4mm, which is important for compatibility with nuts, washers, etc. There's no mention of ERP code here. \n\nSo, the shared info is the screw specs: M8, 65mm. But Text 1's main point is the ERP code, while Text 2 introduces a new dimension (h=4mm). Since Text 2 doesn't mention the ERP code at all, and Text 1 doesn't talk about the h dimension, there's no direct contradiction. However, the question says if any shared information isn't identical, answer 'no'. Wait, but the shared info here is the screw's diameter and length, which are the same. The problem is whether the additional info in Text 2 contradicts anything in Text 1. Since Text 1 doesn't mention the h dimension, maybe it's not conflicting. But the user says to answer 'no' if any shared info isn't identical. Wait, the shared info here is the screw's attributes (M8, 65mm), which are the same. The ERP code and h dimension are additional details. Since the question says to ignore differences in detail, style, or length, but if there's contradictory info or shared info not identical, then 'no'. \n\nWait, but the shared info (M8, 65mm) is identical. The ERP code and h dimension are different pieces of info. Since they don't contradict each other, but add different details, does that count as contradictory? The user says \"if they contain contradictory information or any shared information is not identical\". The shared info (M8, 65mm) is identical. The other info (ERP code vs h dimension) are different but not contradictory. So maybe the answer is 'yes'? But wait, the first text's conclusion is about the ERP code, while the second text's conclusion is about the h dimension. Since they are talking about different attributes, but the main question is whether the semantic meaning is the same. The semantic meaning here is different: one is about the ERP code, the other about a physical dimension. Therefore, they are not the same. So the answer should be 'no' because they are providing different information about the same screw. Even though the shared info (M8, 65mm) is the same, the conclusions are different, so they are not semantically the same. Hence, 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the two texts have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details like style or length. The main thing is whether they contradict each other or if any shared info isn't identical.\n\nLooking at Text 1: It's about determining the ERP code for a specific screw. The screw is M8 diameter, 65mm length, made of steel (MATIERE: ACIER), and the ERP code is 998371.\n\nText 2: Talks about screws with the same dimensions (M8, 65mm) but says they're made of aluminum. It mentions their use in industries because of lightweight and corrosion resistance.\n\nSo the key points here are the material and the ERP code. Text 1 says steel and gives an ERP code. Text 2 says aluminum and doesn't mention an ERP code. The material is contradictory\u2014steel vs. aluminum.
