            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring style or detail differences. If there's a contradiction or non-identical info, answer 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'. \n\nFirst, Text 1 discusses four models with learning rates 0.20, 0.10, 0.03, and 0.01. It says the best stability is with 0.03 and 0.01, leading to smooth loss curves and good convergence. The worst ones are 0.20 and 0.10, which have oscillations.\n\nText 2 talks about the worst model having a learning rate of 102. It mentions loss curves diverging, not approaching zero, loss above 8 after 180 iterations, overfitting, and instability. \n\nWait, Text 1's worst is 0.20 and 0.10, but Text 2's worst is 102. That's a huge difference in learning rate values. 0.20 vs 102 is way off. Also, Text 2's model has loss not below 8, which isn't mentioned in Text 1. Text 1's worst models have oscillations but maybe lower loss. Contradiction here. So the answer should be 'no' because the learning rates mentioned as worst are conflicting and the details about loss values are contradictory.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the two texts have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details, style, or length. They said to answer 'no' if there's contradictory info or if shared info isn't identical. Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nLooking at Text 1: It's analyzing four models with learning rates 0.20, 0.10, 0.03, and 0.01. The conclusion is that 0.03 and 0.01 are the best in stability and convergence. The worst ones are 0.20 and 0.10, with 0.20 being the most unstable.\n\nText 2: Talks about the worst model having a learning rate of 102, which is way higher than any in Text 1. It mentions the loss curves diverge, loss never below 8 after 180 iterations, and poor stability.\n\nSo, Text 1's worst is 0.20, Text 2's worst is 102. The learning rates are completely different. 102 vs 0.20 is a huge difference. Also, Text 2's model fails to converge, diverges, which contradicts Text 1's description of the 0.20 model (oscillations but still part of the analysis). The values here are way too far apart. So, they contradict each other. Answer 'no'.\n\nWait, but maybe the 102 is a typo? Like maybe meant 0.02? But the user says to take the texts as given. So even if it's a typo, according to the instructions, we have to consider the texts as they are. So 102 is way different from 0.20. So the answer is 'no' because the learning rates mentioned are contradictory.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring style or detail differences. They said to answer only yes or no, but I need to think through it first.\n\nText 1 talks about four learning rates: 0.20, 0.10, 0.03, and 0.01. It says that 0.03 and 0.01 are the best because their loss curves are smooth, indicating stability and good convergence. The higher learning rates (0.20 and 0.10) have oscillations and are unstable.\n\nText 2 mentions a learning rate of 102, which is way higher than any in Text 1. It says this model is the least effective, with diverging loss curves, not approaching zero, and a high loss value (above 8 even at iteration 180). It also points out a gap between training and test loss, indicating instability.\n\nWait, Text 1's highest learning rate is 0.20, which is very different from 102 in Text 2. The numbers are orders of magnitude apart. Text 1's worst models are 0.20 and 0.10, but Text 2's worst is 102. Also, Text 1's conclusion is that 0.03 and 0.01 are best, while Text 2 is talking about a completely different learning rate. The values are not just different but way too far apart. Also, Text 2's model is diverging, which contradicts Text 1's analysis where even the higher rates (0.20) have oscillations but not divergence. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno"
