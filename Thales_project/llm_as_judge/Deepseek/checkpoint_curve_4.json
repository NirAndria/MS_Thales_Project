            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring differences in detail, style, or length. If there's any contradictory information or if shared info isn't identical, the answer should be 'no'. Otherwise, 'yes'. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both texts thoroughly. \n\nText 1 is analyzing four models with different learning rates (0.20, 0.10, 0.03, 0.01). It evaluates their stability based on the smoothness of their training and validation loss curves. The conclusion is that models with 0.03 and 0.01 learning rates have the best stability, leading to better convergence and generalization.\n\nText 2 talks about the worst model having a learning rate of 10^2 (which is 100). It mentions that this model's loss curves diverge, don't approach zero, and it can't get below a loss of 8 even after 180 iterations. It also points out overfitting and instability.\n\nWait, the learning rates mentioned in Text 1 are 0.20, 0.10, 0.03, 0.01. Text 2 refers to a learning rate of 10^2, which is 100. That's a much higher rate than any in Text 1. Text 1's highest is 0.20. So Text 2 is talking about a model with a learning rate that's not even present in Text 1. \n\nText 1's worst models are the ones with 0.20 and 0.10, which have oscillations. But Text 2's worst model is 100, which isn't in Text 1. So they're discussing different learning rates. \n\nMoreover, Text 1 says the best are 0.03 and 0.01, while Text 2 doesn't mention those. Instead, it's criticizing a model with a much higher learning rate. Since the learning rates in question don't overlap (100 vs. 0.20, etc.), the information is contradictory. Text 1 doesn't mention a model with 100, and Text 2 doesn't discuss the same models. Therefore, they can't have the same semantic meaning because they refer to different models and reach different conclusions about which are good or bad. \n\nAdditionally, Text 2's model's loss doesn't go below 8, but Text 1's models with 0.20 and 0.10 might have different loss values. However, the key contradiction is the learning rates evaluated. Since they don't share the same models, their conclusions can't be aligned. Hence, the answer should be 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno",

It concludes that the models with 0.03 and 0.01 have the best stability, leading to smooth convergence of training and validation losses. The higher learning rates (0.20 and 0.10) are unstable with oscillations.\n\nText 2 talks about the worst model having a learning rate of 10^2 (which is 100). It says this model's loss curves diverge, never go below 8, and have a large gap between training and test loss, indicating poor stability.\n\nWait, Text 1's highest learning rate is 0.20, while Text 2's worst model is 10^2 (100). That's a big difference. 0.20 vs 100. So Text 1's worst models are 0.20 and 0.10, but Text 2's worst is 100. These are different learning rates. So the models being discussed as bad are different. Text 1 doesn't mention a model with LR 100 at all. \n\nAlso, Text 1 says 0.03 and 0.01 are best, while Text 2 only mentions the worst model (100). There's no overlap in the specific models discussed except maybe the higher LRs. But 0.20 vs 100 is a huge difference. So the information about which models are good or bad is contradictory. Text 1's bad models are 0.20 and 0.10, but Text 2's worst is 100, which isn't even in Text 1. Therefore, they are talking about different models. \n\nAdditionally, Text 2's model with LR 100 has diverging loss, while Text 1's highest LR (0.20) has oscillations but not necessarily divergence. So the behavior described is different. Text 1's 0.20 model is unstable but maybe still converges somewhat, while Text 2's model is diverging. That's a contradiction in the outcomes. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'no' because they discuss different learning rates and contradictory outcomes for the models they mention.\n</think>\n\nno",

If there's contradictory info or non-identical shared info, answer 'no'; else 'yes'. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both texts. \n\nText 1 talks about analyzing four subplots with different learning rates (0.20, 0.10, 0.03, 0.01). It evaluates stability based on how smooth the loss curves are. The conclusion is that 0.03 and 0.01 are the best because their losses decrease smoothly, leading to good convergence and generalization.\n\nText 2 mentions a learning rate of 10^2 (which is 100, but wait, that's way higher than any in Text 1). It says this model is least effective, with diverging training and test loss curves, never approaching zero, and a loss not below 8 by iteration 180. It also points out a wide gap between training and test loss, indicating instability.\n\nWait, Text 1's highest learning rate is 0.20, but Text 2's is 10^2=100. That's a huge difference. So Text 2 is talking about a learning rate that's not even mentioned in Text 1. Text 1's worst model was 0.20, which had oscillations, but Text 2's model at 100 is way worse, with diverging losses. \n\nSo, Text 1 says 0.03 and 0.01 are best. Text 2 says 10^2 (100) is worst. These are different learning rates. The information about the worst model in Text 2 isn't present in Text 1. Also, Text 1's worst model (0.20) is different from Text 2's (100). So there's contradictory info here. Therefore, the answer should be 'no'.\n</think>\n\nno"

It says that the models with 0.03 and 0.01 have the best stability, smooth loss curves, and good convergence. Both training and validation losses decrease smoothly, indicating effective learning and generalization.\n\nText 2 discusses a model with a learning rate of 10^-2, which is 0.01. It says this model has very poor performance, fluctuating loss curves, no convergence to zero, takes too many iterations, and by iteration 18, loss is above 0.8. Also, there's a big gap between training and test losses, suggesting overfitting/underfitting, instability, and lack of generalization.\n\nWait, Text 1 says 0.01 is good, stable, smooth, converges well. Text 2 says 0.01 is bad, unstable, doesn't converge, high loss. That's a direct contradiction. So even though both are talking about the same learning rate (0.01), they present opposite conclusions.

Otherwise, 'yes'.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both texts.\n\nText 1 is analyzing different learning rates (0.20, 0.10, 0.03, 0.01) and their effect on model stability and convergence. It concludes that 0.03 and 0.01 (which is 10^-2) have the best stability, leading to smooth loss curves and good convergence. Both training and validation losses decrease steadily, indicating effective learning and generalization.\n\nText 2 talks about a learning rate of 10^-2 (which is 0.01). It says that this model shows modest progress, with loss curves trending downward but slowly. By iteration 18, the loss hasn't gone below 0.8, implying slower convergence. There's a discrepancy between training and test losses, suggesting instability and limited generalization, though the model isn't completely ineffective.\n\nNow, compare the conclusions about the 0.01 learning rate. Text 1 says 0.01 has good stability, smooth curves, effective convergence, and generalization. Text 2 says 0.01 has slower convergence (still trending down but not below 0.8 by iteration 18), some instability (discrepancy between losses), and limited generalization. \n\nThese are contradictory. Text 1 claims good stability and convergence for 0.01, while Text 2 says it's slower and has instability. Therefore, the answer should be 'no' because the information about the 0.01 learning rate is conflicting.\n</think>\n\nno",
