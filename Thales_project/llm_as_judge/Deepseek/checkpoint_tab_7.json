            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring details like style or length. The main thing is whether there's any contradiction or if key information differs.\n\nIn Text 1, the conclusion is that Hydrangea (ID 17) didn't receive an invitation because the invitation status is \"undeliverable\". The other entries have \"sent\" for invitation status. \n\nText 2 states that Hydrangea (ID 17) didn't receive an invitation, with the invitation status marked as \"undeliverable\". It also mentions possible reasons like incorrect address or postal issues, and implications like exclusion. \n\nBoth texts agree that Hydrangea didn't get the invitation due to the invitation being undeliverable. The additional details in Text 2 about reasons and implications don't contradict the core information in Text 1. Since the main point is the same\u2014Hydrangea's invitation wasn't received because it was undeliverable\u2014there's no contradiction. Values and dates aren't an issue here. So the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\nyes",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring style or length. The key is contradictions or non-identical info.\n\nText 1 concludes that Hydrangea (ID 17) didn't receive an invitation because the invitation was undeliverable. Text 2 says Dahlia (ID 18) didn't receive it, also with undeliverable status. Both are in the Flower group with undeliverable invitations. \n\nWait, the conclusion in Text 1 is Hydrangea, while Text 2 says Dahlia. So they point to different individuals. Even though both have undeliverable invitations, the answer in each text is a different person. That's a contradiction because they each identify a different person as the one not receiving the invitation. So the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the two texts have the same semantic meaning, focusing on whether they contradict each other or if the information isn't identical.\n\nFirst, looking at Text 1. The conclusion is that Hydrangea (ID 17) didn't receive an invitation because their invitation status is \"undeliverable\". The other entries, including Madrona (ID 13), have \"sent\" invitations. So Text 1 points to Hydrangea as the one without an invitation.\n\nNow, Text 2 says Madrona (ID 13) didn't receive an invitation. But wait, in Text 1, Madrona's invitation is marked as \"sent\". Text 2 contradicts that by stating Madrona didn't receive it, even though the invitation was sent. That's a direct contradiction. \n\nThe key here is the invitation status. Text 1 says Hydrangea's invitation was undeliverable, so they didn't get it. Text 2 claims Madrona didn't receive it, but according to Text 1, Madrona's invitation was sent. So the two texts are conflicting on who didn't receive the invitation. \n\nEven if Text 2 mentions that Madrona's invitation was sent, the conclusion that Madrona didn't receive it contradicts Text 1's data. Therefore, the answer should be 'no' because the information about who didn't get the invitation is conflicting.\n</think>\n\nno"

            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring differences in style or detail. The main question is whether they contain contradictory information or if any shared info isn't identical.\n\nText 1 is a detailed breakdown of several individuals from a table. It lists IDs 10 to 18, each with various attributes. The conclusion is that Hydrangea (ID 17) didn't receive an invitation because their invitation status is \"undeliverable\". All others have \"sent\" except Dahlia (ID 18) also has \"undeliverable\". Wait, both Hydrangea and Dahlia have \"undeliverable\" invitations. But the conclusion in Text 1 says Hydrangea is the one who didn't receive. Maybe because both are undeliverable, but the answer only mentions Hydrangea. Hmm.\n\nText 2 talks about Cedar (ID 10), stating that Cedar received an invitation (status sent) and attended. Text 1's conclusion is about Hydrangea not receiving the invitation. So Text 2 is about Cedar receiving it, while Text 1's conclusion is about Hydrangea not. There's no direct contradiction because they're talking about different individuals. However, the question is whether the two texts have the same semantic meaning. Text 1's main point is identifying Hydrangea as not invited, while Text 2 is confirming Cedar was invited. Since they refer to different people and different outcomes (one invited, another not), they don't contradict each other, but they don't share the same semantic meaning either. The answer should be no because they present different information about different subjects. Even though there's no direct contradiction, the shared information isn't identical in their main conclusions. The user's instruction says to answer no if any shared info isn't identical. But here, the main conclusions are different. So the answer is no.\n</think>\n\nno",
            "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if Text 1 and Text 2 have the same semantic meaning, ignoring differences in style or detail. The key is to check for contradictions or non-identical shared information.\n\nText 1 concludes that Hydrangea (ID 17) didn't receive an invitation because their invitation status is \"undeliverable\". All others, including Redwood (ID 11), have \"sent\" invitations. \n\nText 2 states that Redwood (ID 11) did receive an invitation, which matches Text 1's data. However, Text 2's conclusion is about Redwood receiving the invite, while Text 1's conclusion is about Hydrangea not receiving it. \n\nWait, the question is whether the two texts have the same semantic meaning. Text 1's main point is identifying Hydrangea as the one not invited. Text 2's main point is confirming Redwood was invited. Since they don't contradict each other but discuss different individuals, do they share the same overall meaning? The user's instruction says to answer 'no' if there's contradictory info or if shared info isn't identical. Here, Text 2 doesn't mention Hydrangea, and Text 1's conclusion is about Hydrangea. But the texts aren't contradicting each other; they're talking about different people. However, the user's criteria might require that if any shared info isn't identical, answer 'no'. But in this case, the shared info about Redwood is consistent. Text 1 says Redwood's invitation was sent, and Text 2 confirms that. The conclusions are about different individuals, but the question is whether the texts have the same semantic meaning. Since they are addressing different conclusions (Hydrangea vs. Redwood's status), they don't have the same meaning. Therefore, the answer should be 'no' because they present different conclusions, even though the data about Redwood is consistent.\n</think>\n\nno",

All others, including Fir (ID 12), have Invitation marked as \"sent\". \n\nText 2 states that Fir (ID 12) did receive an invitation, with Invitation status \"sent\" and attended. \n\nSo, both texts agree that Fir's invitation was sent. Text 1's conclusion is about Hydrangea not receiving it, while Text 2 is confirming Fir did. There's no contradiction here because they're talking about different individuals. The shared info about Fir is the same in both. Since the question is whether the two texts have the same meaning, and they don't contradict each other in the shared parts, the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\nyes"
