This graph represents a disconnected and isolated network, where each group operates independently with minimal interaction. Each node represents a participant, and the arrows indicate one-way communication, meaning discussions are not reciprocal. The colors distinguish different groups, while the arrows categorize discussions as follows:

Blue arrows indicate conflicts and disagreements.
Gray arrows represent meaningless or random exchanges.
Red arrows show friendly and constructive discussions.
Upon analyzing the graph, Group 1 (yellow) appears to be the most connected, as it is positioned far from the network center and has very few interactions. This suggests that it dominates the discussion and has complete control over the flow of communication. Additionally, the absence of blue arrows around Group 1 means that it is not engaged in any arguments, reinforcing its status as the most active and influential group.

Overall, Group 1 is the central hub of discussions, while Group 7 (green) appears to be the least connected, barely interacting with other groups
