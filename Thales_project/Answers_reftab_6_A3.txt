The brand Fiat recorded a decrease of 23.24% in sales between January 2021 and January 2022. This decrease can be attributed to increased competition in the compact vehicle segment, production issues, or changes in company policies. The implications for Fiat could include a revision of their marketing strategy, improvement in product quality, and efforts to strengthen their market presence.
